longe to lyue therin / And whan they y t thus serue the world / haue vsed theyr lyf in dooyng thise euyll aforsaid Thenne gyueth she to them her doughter that is the deth perpetuelle / that is the reward that the lyf of thys world gyueth to her seruātes / that departe frō thys world despourueyed / And bere nothyng with them but their synnes / After thys / saynt sebastien torned hym to their parentis and frendes and said to them in thys maner / O ye my frendes lo here the lyf of thys world which deceyueth you in suche wise / that ye discounseylle your frendes fro the euerlastyng lyf / ye destrouble your chyldren that they shold not come to the companye of heuene / and to the honoure permanable / and to thamytye of themperour celestyall / by your folyssh wordes / and your false wepynges / yf they shold assente to your repeell / they shold but a whyle dwelle wyth you / And after shold departe fro your companye / where ye shold see them in tormentes that shold neuer ende / where as cruel flam̄e deuoureth the soules of mescreants / and worshippers of ydollis / And the dragons eten the lippes of cursid men / And the serpents destroye them that ben euyll / there where is herd nothyng but wayllyngis / wepyngis / and horryble cryes of sowles whyche brenne contynuelly in the fyre of helle / and euer shal brenne without deyeng / Suffre ye / that your sones escape thyse tormentes / And thynke how ye may escape / And late thē suffre deth for the loue of Ihesu cryste / thenke not / but they whan they shal be thus departed fro you / goon for to make redy your place and your mansion / in heuen / where ye and youre chyldren may be in Ioye perpetuel / In thys houre and tyme that saynt sebastyan y t was in habite of a knyght clad with a mantel / and gyrd wyth a gyrdle of gold and had sayd thyse wordes anone cam a grete light in the whyche appiered a yonglyng clad with a whyte mantel emong vij angellis / And gaf to saynt sebastyan the peas sayeng / thou shalt be alleway with me / Thys sawe the wyf of nychostratus named Zoe / in whos hows marcus & marcellianus were in pryson whyche had ben muet & dombe vj yere by a sekenes that she had / But she had vnderstāden that / whyche saynt sebastian had said / & had seen the lyght aboute hym / And she fyll doun to hys feet / And by signes of her hādes made prayers to hym / And after whan saynt Sebastyan knewe that she had loste her speche / Anone he said to her / yf I be the seruant of Ihesu cryste and yf all that / that I haue said be trewe / thenne I praye hym that he wyl rendre to the thy speche agayn / that opened the mouth of Zacharye the prophete / And anon escryed thys woman moche hye and said / The worde that thou hast said is veray trewe / And blessyd be thou / And the word of thy mouth and blessyd ben alle they that by the byleue in Ihesu cryst the sone of god / For I haue seen certaynly vij angellis to fore the holdyng a book / in whiche was wreton all that / whiche thou hast said / Blessid be all they that byleue that / whiche thou hast said / And cursid be they that byleue the not / And Nichostratus husbonde of this woman and the fader and moder and alle the frendes of marcellianus & marcus / receyueden the crysten faith / And were all baptised by policarpus the preest / vnto the nombre of lxxviij persones men wymen and chyldren / And ten dayes duryng they abode to gydre in orysons and in prayers / and thankyd god of hys benefettes / Emong them was tarquyllynus fader vnto the holy martirs aforsaid whyche had xj yere duryng the gowte in hys feet & handes / And assone as policarpus had baptysed hym / he bicam as hool and sound in his feet & hondes as a chyld After the ten dayes agrestyn / and Comatyn prouostes of Rome made Tarquillinus their fader to come to for hym / And demaunded of hym / how hys sones were aduysed and counseylled / And he answerd moche wel dyde ye whan ye gaf to them respyte / For in the mene tyme they that shold haue deyde haue founde lyf and Ioye / And the prouost supposed that hys sones had ben torned / And said to mo and they may dwelle in peas / And tarquillinus said / gentyl man yf thou wylt Iustly adoure & werke aboute me and my sones / thou shal fynde that the name of crysten men is of grete vertue / And the prouoste said tarquillinus art thou wood / And he answerd / I haue ben out of my wytte / but assone as I bileued in Ihesu cryst / I resseyued helth of body and of sowle / The prouoste said I see wel / that the respyte of thy sones haue brought the in errour / Tarquillinus sayde / knowe of what werkis come errour / The prouost bad hym saye And he said / The first errour is to leue the waye of lyf / and goo by the waye of deth / for to dyspute that men whyche ben deed for to be goddes / and to adoure their ymages / made of wood or of stone / The prouoste said / thenne be they no goddes that we adoure / Tarquillinus said It is redde in our bokes / what men they were that ye adoure for goddes / how euyl they lyued and how meschauntly they deyed / Saturnus whom ye worshippe for god was lord of Crete / and ete the flessh of hys chyldren / how is not he one of your goddes / And Iupiter / hys sone whom ye adoure / whyche slewe hys fader / and toke hys suster to hys wif what euyl was thys / how art thou in grete errour / that adourest thys cursid men / And saist to the ymage of stone thou art my god / And to the stock of tree / helpe me / The prouost said yf ther be none but one god inuisible / that ye adoure / wherfor thenne adoure ye Ihesu cryst / whome the Iewes crucyfyed Tarquillinus answerd / Yf thou knowest a ryng of gold / in whyche were a precious stone lyeng in the myre of a valeye / thou woldest sente thy seruāts for to take vp this ryng / And yf they myght not lefte it vp / thou woldest vnclothe thy self / of thy clothes of silke and doo one a course cote and woldest helpe to take vp thys rynge and make grete feste / The prouost said wherfor hast thou put forth this proposiciō now Tarquillinus answerde / For to shewe to the / that we adoure one only god / The prouost said what vnderstondest y u by thys ryng / Tarquillinus said / the gold of the rynge is the body humayne / And the precious stone signefieth the sowle whiche is enclosed in the body / The body and the sowle make a man / lyke as the gold and the precious stone make a rynge / And moche more precioous is the man to Ihesu cryst / than the rynge is to the / Thou sendest thy seruants for to take vp this ryng out of the dyrte or myre / And they may not / Thus sente god in to thys world the prophetes for to drawe the humayne lygnage out of thordure of synnes / and they myght not doo it And lyke as thou sholdest leue thy ryche clothis and clothe the with a course cote / and woldest descende in to the pryue and put thy handes in to foule ordure to take vp the rynge / Ryght so the mageste of god hydde the lyght of hys dyuynyte by a carnal vestement whyche he toke of our nature humayne And clad hym therwith / and descendeth fro heuen / and cam here bynethe in to the pryue of this world / and put hys hondes / in thordure of oure myseryes in suffryng hungre and thurst / And toke vs vp out of the fylthe / & weessh vs fro our synnes by the water of baptesme / And thus he whyche dispyseth the by cause thou shold descende in a foule habyte to take vp the ryng thou myghtest wel put hym to deth / Thus all they that renye or despise Ih̄u cryst / by cause he humbled hym self for to saue man / maye in no wyse escape for the deth of helle / The prouost said I see wel that thyse ben but fables / Thou hast take respyte for thy sones / knowest thou not well that thēperour our lord is cruell ayenst crysten men Tarquillinus said it is folye to doubte more humayne puyssaunce / than the puyssaunce dyuyne They that ben cruel ayenst vs / maye wel tormente our bodyes / but they may not take fro our herte Ihesu cryst / Thenne the prouost put put tarquillinus in the handes of the sergeantis sayeng shewe to me the medycine by whiche thou art helyd of thy gowte / And I shal gyue to the gold without nombre / knowe thou that moche euyl shal come to them that selle & bye the grace of god / but yf thou wilt be hole of the maladye of the gowte / byleue in Ihesu cryst / and thou shal be as hole as I am / The prouoste said brynge hym to me that hath heled the / Tarquillinus wente to polycarpus / & said to hym alle thys / And brought hym wyth saynt sebastian vnto the prouost and enformed hym in the faith And he praid hem that he myght haue his helthe / And saynt sebastian sayd that he shold first renye hys ydollis / & yeue hym licence to breke them / and thenne he shold haue hys helthe / Thēne Comasyn the prouost said that hys seruants shold breke them / saynt sebastian said / they ben aferd and dar not breke them / And yf the fendis hurte ony of them by ony occasion the mysbyleuers wold saye / that they were hurte by cause they brake their goddes / And thenne policarpe and saynt sebastian destroyed moo than CC ydollis / Thenne said they to the prouost / why hast not thou receyued the helthe whyl shewed them a chābre whyche was light as had ben of sterris / whervpon hys fader had dyspendyd CC poys of gold / by which he knewe thyngis for to come / Thenne said saynt sebastian / as longe as thou kepest thys hole / thou maist neuer haue helth / And thenne he agrered it shold be broken / Tyburcien hys sone whyche was a noble yong man sayd playnly / that so noble a werke shold not be destroyed / how wel I wyl not be agayn my fadres helthe / thys wylle I wel that ther be ordeyned ij furneyses of fyre brennyng / and thenne I wyll that ye destroye thys werke / and yf my fader haue hys helthe / I shal be content / And yf he receyue not hys helthe thenne I will that ye ij shal be brent in thyse ij furneyses of fyre all quyck / And saynt sebastian saide / be it / as thou hast said / And forthwyth they wente and breke the chambre / & in the mene whyle / the angele of our lord appyered to the prouost and said hys helthe was gyuen to hym / And anon he was all hool / and ranne after hym for to haue kyssed his fete / but he denyed hym For he had not receyued baptesme / And thenne he and Tyburcien hys sone wyth a MCCCC of theyr famylye were baptysed / Thenne Zoe was taken of the mescreants and was tormēted so longe that she gaf vp the spirite And whan tarquillinus herd that / he cam forth and said / Alas why lyue we so longe / wymen goon to fore vs to the crowne of martirdom / And with in a fewe dayes after / he was stoned to deth / And Tyburcien was comanded that he shold goo barefoot vpon brennyng coles / or ellis doo sacrefise to thydollis / And thenne he made the signe of the crosse vpon the coles / and wente on them bare foot / And he said me thynketh I goo vpon Roose flowres in the name of our lord Ihesu cryst / To whom fabien the prouoste said / It is not vnknowen to vs that your Ihesu cryst is a techar of Sorcerye / To whō Tyburcien said / holde thy peas thou cursid wretche / For thou art not worthy to nempne so worthy / so holy / ne so swete a name / Thenne the prouost was wroth / and comanded to smyte of hys heed / and so he was martred / And thenne marcellianus and marcus were sore tormentid and bound to a pyler / and as they were so bounden they seyden / loo how good & Ioyeful it is / brethern to dwelle to gydre To whom the prouost said / ye wretchis doo away your madnes / and delyure your self / And they sayde / we were neuer so wel fedde / we wold that thou woldest late vs stonde here / tyl that the spirites shold departe out of our bodyes / And thenne the prouost comāded that they shold be percid thurgh the body with speris / And so they fulfilled their martirdom / after this saynt sebastian was accused to thēperour that he was crysten / Wherfore dyoclesian themperour of Rome made hym come to fore hym / And said to hym I haue alleway loued the wel / and haue made the maistre / of my palays / how thēne hast thou be crysten pryuely ayenst my helthe and in despyte of our goddes / Saynt sebastian said / allewaye I haue worshyppid Ihesu cryst for thy helthe / and for thestate of Rome / And I thynke for to praye and demande helpe of thydollis of stone / is a grete folye wyth thyse wordes dyoclesian was moche angry and wroth / and comanded hym to be ladde to the felde / and there to be bounden to a stake / for to be shotte at / And the archers shotte at hym tyl he was as ful of arowes as an hirchon is ful of prickis / And thus lefte hym there for deed The nyght after cam a crysten woman for to take hys body and to burye it / but she fonde hym a lyue / and brought hym to her hows / and toke charge of hym tyl he was all hool / Many crysten men cam to hym whyche counseylled hym to voyde the place / but he was comforted / and stode vpon a stappe where themperour shold passe by / and said to hym / the bysshoppis of thydolles deceyue you euyll / whyche accuse the crysten men to be contrayre to the comyn prouffyt / of the cyte / that praye for your estate / & for the helthe of Rome / dyoclesyan said arte not thou sebastyen / whom we comanded to be shoten to deth / And saynt Sebastian saide / therfor our lord hath rendred to me lyf / to thende that I shold telle you / that euylle and cruelly ye doo persecucions vnto crysten men / Thenne made dyoclesyan hym to be brought in to pryson in to hys palays / And to bete hym so sore wyth stones tyl that he deyde / And the tyrauntis threwe hys bodye in to a grete pryuee / by cause the crysten men / shold make no feste to burye hys body / ne of hys martredom / but saynt sebastian appyerid after to saynt lucyne a glorious wydowe / And said to her in suche a pryue shalt thou fynde my body hangyng at an hoke / whyche is not defouled with none ordure / whan thou hast wasshed it / thou shal burye it at Cathacombes by the appostlis / And the same nyght she and her seruantes accomplysshyd alle that sebastian had comanded her / he was martred the yere of our lord CClxxxvij / And seynt gregory telleth in the first boke of h wedded was prayd for to goo wyth other wymen to the dedicacion of the chyrche of sebastian / and the nyght to fore she was so moeued in her flessh / that she myght not absteyne her from her husbond / And on the morn she hauyng gretter shame of men than of god wente theder / and anon as she was entryd in to the oratorye where the relyques of saynt sebatian were / the fende toke her and tormentid here byfore all the people / And thenne the preest toke the couerture of the aulter and couerd her / And thēne the deuyl assaylled the preest / her frendes lad her to thenchauntours / that that they shold enchaunte the fende / but assone as they began thenchaunte by the Iugemēt of god a legion of deuylles entryd in to her / that is vjMvjClxvj / and vexid her more sharply than to fore / And an holy man named formatus by hys prayers heled her / It is redde in the gestes of y e lōbardis that in the tyme of kynge gylberte all ytalye was smeton wyth so greet a pestilence / that vnnethe they that were alyue myght burye the dede / And this pestylence was most at Rome and pauye / Thenne the good Angele was seen vysybly of many and an euyl Angele folowyng beryng a staf whom le bad smyte and slee / And as many strokes as he smote an hows / so many deede persones were born out of it / Thenne at laste it was shewed to one by goddes grace / that this pestylence shold not cesse / tyl that they had made an aulter to saynt sebastian at pauye / whiche thenne was made in the chyrche of saynt peter / and anone the pestylence seassed / And thyder fro rome relyques of saynt sebastian were brought / And saynt Ambrose in his preface saith thus / O lord the blood of thy blessyd martir saynt sebastian was shedd for the confession of thy name / he hath shewed thy meruaylles / that they prouffyte in infirmyte vertue and gyueth to our studyes prouffyt / and to them not stedfast to the it gyueth ayde and helpe / Thenne late vs praye to this holy martir saynt sebastian / that he praye vnto our lord that we may be delyuerd from all pestylence and sodeyn deth / and so departe aduysedly hens that we may come to euer lastyng Ioye and glorye in heuen / •n I shal see / how thy sones shal make sacrefyse to thydolles / by whom thou •s we brake thydollis / thou kepest yet thy mysbyleue / or ellis kepest yet som̄e ydollis / Thenne he •s dyaloges / that a woman of tuskane whych was newe Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Sebastian And next foloweth of saynt Agnes / and first thynterpretacion of her name AGnes is said of agna a lambe / For she was humble and debonayr as a lambe / or of agno in greke / whyche is to saye debonayr / and pyteous / For she was debonayr and mercyful / Or agnes of agnoscendo / for she knewe the waye of trouthe / and after thys saynt Austyn saith / trouthe is opposed ayenst vanyte / falsenes / & doublenes / For thyse thre thyngis were taken from her / for the trouthe that she had / ¶Of saynt Agnes THe blessyd virgyne seynt Agnes was moche wyse and wel taught as saynt Ambrose wytnesseth / and wrote her passyon she was fayr of vysage / but moche fayrer in the crysten fayth / she was yong of age / & aged in wytte / For in the xiij yere of her age / she lost the deth that the world gyueth / And fonde lyf in Ihesu cryst / whyche whan she cam fro scole / the sone of the perfecte of Rome for themperour louyd her / And whan hys fader and moder knewe it / they offred to gyue moche Rychesse wyth hym / yf he myght haue her in maryage / And offryd to saynt Agnes precyous gēmes and Iewellis / whyche she refused to take / wherof it happed that the yong man was ardauntly esprysed in the loue of saynt Agnes / and came agayn and toke wyth hym more precious & Rycher adournementes / made wyth all maner of precious stones / And as wel by hys parentes as by hym self offred to saynt agnes Ryche yeftes / and possessyons / and all the delytes and deduytes of the world / and all to thende to haue her in maryage / but saynt agnes answerd to hym in thys mater / Goo fro me thou fardel of synne / norysshyng of euyllys / and morsell of deth / and departe / And knowe thou that I am preuented / and am loued of another louer / whych hath gyuen to me many better Iewellis / whych hath fyanced me by his fayth / And is moche more noble of lygnage than thou art / & of estate / he hath clad me wyth precyous stones / and wyth Iewellis of golde / he hath sette in my vysage a signe / that I receyue none other espowse but hym / And hath shewde me ouer grete tresours / whiche he must gyue me / yf I abyde wyth hym / I wyl haue none other spowse but hym / I wyl seche none other / In no maner may I leue hym / wyth hym am I ferme and fastned in loue / whyche is more noble more puyssant / & fayrer than ony other whos loue is moche swete and gracious of whom the chambre is now redy for to receyue me / where the virgynes syngyn meryly / I am now embraced of hym / of whome the moder is a vyrgyne / And hys fader knewe neuer woman / to whom the angelles serue / the sonne and the mone merueylle them of hys beaute / whos werkes neuer faylle whos Rychesses neuer mynusshe / by whos odour dede men reyse agayn to lif by whos touchyng the seke men be conforted / whos loue is chastyte / To hym I haue gyuen my faith / To hym I haue comanded my herte / whan I loue hym thenne am I chaste / and whan I touche hym thēne am I pure and clene / And whan I take hym thenne am I a virgyne / Thys is the loue of my god whan the yong man had herd all this he was despayred / as he that was taken in blynde loue / and was ouer fore tormented in so moche that he laye doun seke in hys bedde for the grete sorowe that he had / Thenne cam the fysiciens & anon knewe hys maladye / and sayd to hys fadre that he languysshid of carnal loue / that he had to som̄e woman Thenne the fader enquyred and knewe that it was thys woman / And dyde doo speke to seynt agnes for hys sone and said to her how hys sone languysshid for her loue / seynt agnes answerd that in no wise she wold breke the faith of her first husbond / vpon that / the prouost demāded who was her first husbond of whom she so moche auaunted / and in hys power so moche trusted / Thenne one of her seruauntes said that she was crysten / and that she was so enchaunted / that she said Ihesu cryste was her espowse / And whan the prouoste herde that she was crysten / the prouost was moche glad by cause to haue power on her / For thenne the crysten peple were in the wylle of the lord / yf they wold not renye theyr god and theyr byleue / all theyr goodes shold be forfayted / wherfore thēne the prouoste made saynt agnes to come in Iustice / And he examyned her swetely / and after cruelly by menaces / Saynt agnes wel comforted sayd to hym / doo what thou wylt / For my purpoos shalt thou neuer chaunge / & whan she sawe hym nowe flateryng and now terrybly angry / she scorned hym / And the prouost said to her beyng all Angry / One of two thyngis thou shalt chese / eyther doo sacrefyse to our goddes wyth the vyrgyns of the goddes vesta / or goo to the bordell to be abandonned to alle that thyder come to the grete shame and blame of alle thy lygnage / Saynt Agnes answerd / yf thou knewest who is my god / thou woldest not saye to me suche wordes / but for as moche as I know y e vertue of my god / I sette nothyng by thy menaces / For I haue his angele which is kepar of my body / Thenne the Iuge all araged made to take of her clothys and all nakyd to be ledde to the bordell And thus saynt agnes that refused to doo sacrefyse to thydollys / was delyueryd nakyd to goo to the bordell / but anon as she was vnclothed god gaf to her suche grace that the heeris of her heed bycam so longe / that they couerd all her body to her feet / so that her body was not seen / And whan saynt agnes entred in to the bordell / anon she fonde thangele of god redy for to defende her / and enuyronned saynt agnes with a bryght clernes in suche wise that noman myht see her ne come to her / There made she of the bordel her oratorye And in makyng her prayers to god / she sawe to fore her a whyte vesture / And anon therwith she clad her / and saide / I thanke the Ihesu cryst whyche accomptest me wyth thy virgyns and hast sente me thys vesture / Alle they that entred made honour and reuerence to the grete clerenes that they sawe a boute saynt Agnes / And cam oute more deuoute and more clene than they entred / Atte laste cam the sone of the prouoste with a grete cōpanye / for taccomplysshe his foule desires and lustes And whan he sawe hys felaws come out and yssue all abasshyd / he mocqued them and callyd them cowardis And thenne he all araged entryd for taccomplyssh hys euyl wyll / and whā he cam to the clerenes / he auaunced hym for to take the virgyne / And anon the deuyl toke hym by the throte and strangled hym that he fyl doun deed / And whan the prouoste herde thyse tidynges / of his sone / he ranne wepyng to the bordel / and began cryeng to saye to saynt agnes / O thou cruel woman why hast thou shewde thyn enchantem̄t on my sone / and demaunded of her how hys sone was deed and by what cause / To whom saynt agnes answerd he toke hym in to hys power / to whom he had abaundonned hys wylle / why ben not all they deed said he / that entred here to fore hym / For hys felawes sawe the myracle of the grete clernes and were aferd and wente theyr waye vnhurte / For they dyde honour to my god whyche hath clad me wyth thyse vestement / and hath kept my body / but your vylaynous sone / assone as he entred in to thys hows began to braye and crye / and whan he wold haue leyde honde vpon me / anon the deuyl slewe hym as thou seest / yf thou maye reyse hym said he / It may wel appere that thou hast not put hym to deth / And saynt agnes answerd how wel that thy creance is not worthy to impetre ne gete that of our lord / neuertheles by cause it is tyme that the vertue of god be shewed Goo ye all oute that I may make my prayer to god / And whan she was in her prayers / thangele cam and reysed hym to lyf / And anon he wente out / and bygan to crye wyth an hye voys / that the god of crysten men was very god in heuen and in erthe / and in the See / And that thydolles were vayne that they worshypped / whyche myght not helpe them self ne none other / Thenne the bysshops of thydolles made a grete discorde emonge the peple / so that alle they cryed / Take away this sorceresse and witche that torned mennes myndes / and alyeneth theyr wyttes / whā the prouoste sawe thyse merueylles he wold gladly haue delyuerd saynt agnes / by cause she had reysed hys sone but he doubted to be banysshyd / And sette in hys place a lyeutenaūt named aspasius / for to satisfye the peple / and by cause he coude not delyuere her / he departed soroufully / Thys asp and dyde do caste saynt Agnes therin / Anon as thys was doon the flamme departed in to two partyes / & brente them that made the discordes / & she abode alle hole wythout felyng the fyre / The peple wente that she had don all by enchauntement / Thenne made saynt agnes her oryson to god thankyng hym that she was escaped fro the paryll to lese her virgynyte / and also fro the brennyng of the flamme / And whan she had made her oryson / the fyre loste all hys hete / and quenchyd it aspasius for the doubtance of the peple comanded to put a swerd in her body / And so she was martred / Anon cam the crysten men and the parentis of saynt Agnes and buryed her body / but the hethen defended it / and caste so stones at them / that vnnethe they escaped / She suffred martirdom in the tyme of constantyn the grete / whyche began to regne the yere of our lord CCCix / Emong them that buryed her body ther was one Emerenciana whyche had be felaw to saynt Agnes / how be it she was not yet cristened / but an holy virgyne / she cam also to the sepulces of saynt agnes / whyche constātly repreued the gentyles / and of thē she was stoned to deth / and slayn / Anon thenne cam a erthe quaue / lightnyng / and thondre / that many of the paynems perisshed / so that for And the body of Emerencian was buryed by the body of saynt Agnes / It happed that whā the frendes of seynt Agnes watched at her sepulcre on a nyght / they sawe come a grete multitude of virgynes clad in vestymentes of gold and siluer / and a grete light shone to fore them / And on the right side / was a lambe more whyte than snowe / and sawe also saynt Agnes emong the virgynes / whyche said to her parentes / Take hede / and see that ye bewaylle me nomore as deed / but be ye Ioyeful wyth me / For with all thise virgynes Ihesu cryst haue gyue me most and dwellyng / And am with hym Ioyned in heuen / whō in erthe I loued wyth my thouht / And thys was the viij day after her passyō And by cause of thys vysion / holy chyrche maketh memoyre of her / the viij day of the feste after / whyche is called Agnetis secundo / Of her we rede an example / that in the chyrche of saynt agnes was a preest whych was named paulus / and allewaye serued in that chyrche / and had right grete temptacion of hys flesshe / but by cauhe doubted to angre our lord / he kepte hym fro synne / And prayd to the pope that he wold gyue hym leue for to marye / The pope considered hys symplenesse and for hys boūte he gaf hym a rynge in whych was an emerawde / and c that he •manded shold goo to thymage of saynt Agnes / whyche was in hys chyrche / and praye her that she wold be hys wyf / Thys symple man dyde so / And thymage put forth her fyngre / And he sette the rynge theron / And thenne she drewe her fyngre agayn and kept the ryng faste / And thenne anon all hys tempptacion carnall was quenchyd and take away from hym / And yet as it is said the rynge is on the fyngre of thymage / •sius dyde do make a grete fyre emong alle the peple / •hon the crysten peple myght surely come to the sepulcre vnhurte / ••yghtyst habytacion Constaunce the doughter of Constantyn was smeton wyth a sore and foul lepre / whan she had herd of the vysion of saynt agnes at her tombe sh And whan she was in her prayers she fill a slepe / And she sawe in her slepe saynt agnes sayeng to her Constaunce werke constantly / And yf thou wylt byleue in cryst / y u shalt anon be delyuerd of thy sekenes / wherwyth she awoke / and fonde her self perfyghtly hool / & anon she receyuyd baptesme and founded a chyrche vpon the body of the virgyne / And ther abode in her virgynyte / and assembled there many virgynes by cause of her good ensample / In an other place it is redde that whan the chyrche of saynt agnes was voyde / the pope said to a preest / that he wold gyue to hym a wyf for to norysshe and kepe / and he mente to cōmyse the chyrche of saynt agnes to hys cure / And he delyueryd to hym a rynge and bad hym to wedde thymage / And thymage put forth her fyngre / and he sette on it the ryng / and anon she closid the fynger to her hand and kept the rynge / and so espoused her / Of thys vyrgyne sayth saynt Ambrose in the book of vyrgynes / ¶ Thys vyrgyne / yong men / olde men / and chyldren preyse / ¶ Ther is none more to be praysed / than that may be praysed of all / Saynt Ambrose saith in hys preface that this blessyd saynt Agnes despysed the delytes of noblesse / and deserued heuenly dygnyte / she lefte the desires of mannes felawshyp / and she fonde the felawshyp of the euerlastyng kynge / And she receyuyng a precious deth for the confession of Ihesu cryst / is made conformable to hym / euerlastyngly to regne in Ioye in heuen / to the whyche he brynge vs / for whos glorious name and faith / thys gloryous vyrgyne saynt Agnes suffred martirdom of deth / •wed to her frendes / she cam to the sepulcre of saynt agnes / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Agnes Here begynneth thynterpretacion of the name of saynt vyncent Vyncent is as moche to saye as brennyng vyces or ouercomyng brennynges / and kepyng victorye / For he brente and destroyed vyces by mortificacion of hys flessh / he vaynquysshid the brennyngis of tormentis by stedfast suffraunce / he helde the victorye of the world by despysyng of the same / he vaynquysshyd thre thynges in the world / that is to wete false errours / foule loues and wordly dredes / whyche thynges he ouercam / by wysedom / by clennesse / and by constaunce / Of whom saynt Austyn saith that the martirdoms of sayntes haue enseygned / that the world is ouercome wyth all errours / loues / and dredes / ¶ And som̄e afferme that saynt Austyn wrote and compyled hys passyon / whyche prudencien sette right clerly in versis / Of the lyf of saynt vyncent Vyncente was noble of lygnage / but he was more noble by fayth and relygion / And was deken to saynt valeryen bysshop / he was in hys chyldhode sette to studye / where by dyuyne prouydence he floured in double science / most parfoundly / that is to saye in dyuynyte and humanyte / To whom saynt valerien by cause he was empesshyd in hys tongue comysed to hym the fayttes and werkes of charge And hym self entended to prayer and contemplacion / And by the comandement of dacian the prouost vyncent and valeryen were drawen to valence / and there caste in pryson / And whan the prouost had supposed they had ben almost perysshyd for hungre and payne / he comanded them to come to fore hym / And whan he sawe them hool & Ioyeful / he beyng wroth began to crye moche / strongly and sayd / what saist thou valeryen whyche vnder the name of thy relygyon doost ayenst the decrees of prynces / And as the blessyd valeryen answerd lyghtly / Saynt vyncente sayd to hym / worshypful fader answere not hym so wyth a tymerous herte / but put out thy voys and escrye hym frely / And fader yf thou wylt comande me / I shal goo answere to the Iuge / To whom valerian said right dere sone it is longe sith I haue cōmysed to the / the charge of spekyng And now it byhoueth the to answere for the fayth / for whyche we ben here / Thenne saynt vyncent torned to the Iuge and said to dacyan / Thou hast holden vnto now / wordes to renye our faith / but knowe thou that it is grete felonnye to the wysedome of crysten men to blame and renye our crysten fayth / Thenne dacyan beyng wroth comāded that the bysshop shold be put in exile / And vyncente as a man presumptuous and despytons shold be put to be tormented in the place named eculeo / And it was made lyke a crosse twhart of whyche the two endes were fyxed in therthe / And that hys membres shold theron be broken for to fere the other / And whan he was all thus to broken / dacian said to hym / saye vyncente now seest thou thy body vnhappy / And vyncent smylyng sayd to hym / Thys is that I all way haue desired / Thēne the prouoste beyng wroth began to saye & menace hym with many turm̄tis / And vyncent said to hym / O vnhappy man how wenest thou to angre me / the more greuously that thou tormentest me / so moche more pyte shal god haue on me / Aryse vp thou vnhappy / man and cursid / and by thy wyckyd spyrite y u shalt be vaynquysshyd / For thou shalt me fynde more strenger by the vertue of god to suffre thy tormentis / than thou hast power to tormente me / Thenne the prouoste was angry / and began to crye / And the bochers toke scorgis and roddes & began to smyte and bete hym wyth roddes of yron / And saynt vyncent said / what saist thou dacyen / thou thy self auengest me of my tormentes / Thenne the prouost was wood & sayd to the bochers / ye wretches what doo ye why faylle and wexe faynt your hondes / ye haue ouercomen murdrers & aduoultrers / so that they coude hyde nothyng emong your tormentes / and thys vyncent only shal mowe surmoūt your tormentes / Thenne the bochyers toke combes of yron / and began to kembe hym on the sides within the flesshe / that the blood ran doun ouer all hys body / And that thentrayllis and guttes appiered by the Ioyntures of hys sides / And dacyen said to hym / vyncent haue pyte on thy self / in suche wise that y u mayst recouer thy fayr yongthe and wynne to spare the tormentes / that ben yet to come / And vyncente said to hym / O venymous tongue of the deuyll / I doubte nothyng thy tormentes / but I fere sore only / that thou wylt fayne to haue mercy on me / For so moche more as I see the angry / so moche more am I reioysed / I wyll tha and was brought vnto a torment of fyre / and he blamed and repreued the bochyers of their longe taryeng / Thenne wyth hys good wyll / he mounted vpon the gredyron and ther was rosted broylled and brente in all hys membres / and was styked wyth smal and pryckyd wyth brennyng poyntels of yron / And whan the blood ran in to the fyre / and made woundes vpon woundes / thenne they caste salt in to the fyre / that it shold sparkle and spryng in the woūdes of hys body / on alle partes of the woundes / that it shold more cruelle brenne and doo hym more payne on hys body / by the flammes / in suche wyse that the pryckys of yren myght not holde on hys membres / but on his entraylles whyche henge out of hys body / so that he myght not meue hym / And for all thys he was vnm prayd our lord Ihesu cryst wyth Ioyned hondes vp to heuen / And whā the mynystres had said thys to dacien he said / Alas we ben all vaynquysshyd / and he lyueth yet / And by cause he may yet lyue lenger / shet ye hym in a moche derke pryson / And gadre to gydre all the sharp shellis / & prycke them in hys feet / And late hym be stratched on thē wythout ony humayn comforte / And whan he shal be deed come and telle me / And thyes right cruel mynystres obeyed hym as to theyr lord right cruel / but the kyng for whō he suffred the payne so inhumayne / chaunged to hym all thys in to chaced away out of the pryson / by grete light And the sharpnes of the shelles were torned in to softnes and swetenes of alle maner flowres / hys feet were vnbounde / and he vsed the conforte of thonour of Angellis / And lyke as he had goon on the flowres syngyng wyth angellis / The swete soun of the songe and the swetnes and odour of the flowres whyche was merueyllous was smelled out of the pryson / And whan the kepers had seen thurgh the creuaces of the pryson / this that they sawe within / they were cōuerted / and torned to the faith / And whan dacyan herde this / he was wood & said / what shal we do to hym more / we ben ouercomen / Now thēne late hym be born in to a right softe bedde with softe clothes / so that he be not made more gloryous / and to the ende that he dye not yet / but that he be made strong agayn / and be kembid agayn / in newe tormentis And whan he was brought in a softe bedde / and had therin rested a whyle he rendred and gaf vp hys speryte vnto god in the yere of our lord CC lxxxviij / vnder dyoclesian and maximyen Emperours / And whan dacian herd saye that he was deed / he was moche sorouful / And sayd that in that wyse he was also vaynquysshyd / but sith I myght not ouercome hym lyuyng / I shal punysshe hym deed / And yf I may not haue victorye / I shal be fowled of the payne / Thenne the body of saynt vyncent was caste in a felde for to be deuoured of the bestes and fowles / by the comandement of dacian / but it was kepte wyth angellis / fro towchyng of ony beeste / And after cam a rauen whyche droof awaye all other byrdes and fowles / gretter than he was / and chaced away also a wulf wyth hys bylle and becke / and thenne torned hys heed toward the body / as he that meruaylled of the kepyng of thaungellis / And whan dacyen herd thys thyng / I trow sayd he that I may not surmounte hym whan he is deed / Thenne comanded he that he shold be caste in to the see wyth a myllne stone bounden to hys necke / to thende that he that myght not be destroyed vpon therthe of bestes / shold be deuoured in the see of belues and grete fysshes / Thenne the maronners that ladde the body in to the see / caste it therin / but the body was sonner arryued a londe / than the maronners were / And was founden of a lady and of som̄e other by the reuelacion of Ihesu cryst / And was honourably buryed of them / And saynt Austyn sayth of this holy blessyd martir saynt vyncent that he vaynquysshid so in wordes / he vaynquysshed in paynes / he vaynquysshed in confession / he vaynquysshyd in tribulacion / he ouercam the fyre / he ouercam the water / he vaynquysshyd deth / and vaynquysshyd lyf / Thys vyncent was tormented for to dwelle wyth god / he was scorgyd for to be introduced / he was beten for to be enstrengthed / he brente to be purged / he was gladder of the dredde of god than of the world he had leuer plese god than the world And had leuer deye to the world thā to god / Also saynt Austyn sayth in another place that a merueyllous thyng is sette to fore our eyen / that is a wyckyd Iuge a cruel tormentor / and a martyr not ouercomen / And prudencien wrote of cruelte and pyte / sayeng that vyncent sayd to dacien / the torm̄tes of the pryson / the naylles / the vngles / the streynynge combes of yron with the flāmes of fyre / & deth whiche is laste ende of the paynes / all thise ben playes & Iapes to cristen men / Thenne dacian said as ouercomen / bynde hym and drawe his armes out of theyr Ioyntes / And breke ye all the bones in suche wyse that alle the membres be departed / to thende that the breth of hym sprynge out by the holis of hys membres so torne / And the knyght of god lawhed at thyse thyngis / and blamed the blody handes / by cause they put not the hokes and naylles depper in hys membres / And whan he was in the pryson / the Angele of god said to hym / Aryse vp

Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Basylle bysshop / and first of the interpretacion of hys name BAsille is said of basis in greke / which is as moche to saye as a foūdement / & leos / that is peple / For he was foūdement of them that wold go to their maker / or ellis it is sayd of basilisco a serpente / For he ouercam the serpent • enemye of mankynde / Of the lyf of saynt Basille SAynt Basille was a venerable bysshop / and a solempne doctour of whom Amphilonus bysshop of ycome wrote the lyf / And it was shewde in a vision to an hermyte named effraym how moche holy he was / On a tyme as the

to comforte hym / and marked hym wyth the signe of the crosse / And closyd hym agayn / and he wente and prayd for hym / After certayn dayes passed he wente and vysited hym agayn / and askyd how it was with hym / And he answerd moche better than to fore / I here theyr clamours / and theyr menaces / but I see them not / Saynt basylle gaf hym mete / and closyd the dore and blessyd hym / and wente and prayd god for hym / and xl dayes after he retorned and sayd to hym / my sone how is it wyth the / he answerd holy fader it is wel wyth me thys daye / for I haue seen the fyght for me and ouercomen the

For I am a man synnar as thou art whyche haue nede of pardon as moche as thou / And as she that was besy and greuous to hym he said to her goo vnto the holy man that is named effraym / and demaunde of hym that he may gete pardon for the / And whan she cam to the holy man Effraym / and had tolde to hym wherfor she was sente to hym fro saynt basylle / he sayd to her / goo fro me for I am a synful man / but goo agayn to saynt basylle / And it is he that may gete the foryefnes for thys synne / lyke as he dyde for the other And haste the to thēde / that thou maist fynde hym alyue / And whan she cam in to the cyte / saynt basylle was born to the chyrche for to be buryed / And she bygan to crye sayeng / god and the / For thou mayst wel appease god for me / And thou hast sente me to an other / and anon she threwe the bylle vpon the coueryng of the byere / ¶ And anon after she toke it agayn and opend it and founde hyt alle playn and out clene of the bylle / ¶ And thenne wyth other she gaf thankynges to god ¶ To fore or saynt basylle deyde / he beyng in the maladye that he deyde / he dyde do come a Iewe to hym which was moche expert in physyke / And he louyd hym by cause he sawe that he shold be conuerted to the fayth / And whan he was come he felte hys puls / and sawe that he was nyghe hys ende / and sayd to hys meyney / Make ye redy suche thyng as byhoueth for hys sepulture / For he shal deye anon / whyche worde saynt basylle herd / and sayd to hym / thou woste not what thou sayest / And the Iewe named Ioseph sayd to hym / thys day shalt thou dye whan the sonne shal goo doun in the weste / To whom saynt basylle sayd / what shal thou saye yf I deye not t sayd / Syre it is not other wyse possyble / thenne sayd saynt basylle yf I lyue vnto the morowe none what shalt thou doo / And Ioseph sayde yf thou lyue vntyl the morow that houre / I shal deye / And saynt basylle sayd thou sayst trouthe / thou shal dye / that is synne shal dye in the to thēde that y u lyue in Ih̄u criste / & Ioseph said / I wote wel what y u saist and yf thou lyue vnto that tyme I shal doo that thou saist / Thēne saynt basille said how wel that by nature he shold haue deyde anon forthwith / yet he gate and Impetred of god space that he shold not thēne deye / & lyued vnto the morn at none / which thyng seyng Ioseph merueylled moche and byleued in Ihesu crist / Saynt basille thēne toke herte & ouercam the feblenes of the body / & aroos out of his bedde / & wente to y e chirche / and with his propre handes baptysed the Iewe / And after retorned to his bedde / & anon gaf vp his spirite & rendryd his sowle vnto god / aboute the yere of our lord iijClxx / Thenne lat •ye for hym vnto the tyme that thou shalt delyuer hys wrytyng / And thus as saynt basylle prayd holdyng the honde of the yong mā / the cedule whiche he had made was brought in thayer in the sight of alle / & was leyde in the honde of saynt basylle / the which receyued it / & •hyse lettres / & he •e Iuge bytwene me •ys day to whom Ioseph • vs praye to hym that he gete vs grace of our lord Ihesu cryst / that he wyll foryeue vs all our synnes / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Basille Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Iohan the Almosner SAynt Iohan the Almosner was patriack of Ih̄rlm / he sawe on a tyme in a vision a moche fair mayde which had on her hede a crowne of olyue / and whā he sawe her he was gretly abasshid & demaūded her what she was this maide answere to hym / I am mercy which brought fro heuē the sone of god yf thou wilt wedde me y u shalt fare the better / Thēne he vnderstandyng y t tholyue bit and he called alleway the poure peple his lordes Thēne he called his seruants & said to thē goo thurgh the cite & write ye all y e names of my lordes / and whan he sawe that they vnderstode not his wordes / he said to them / they ben they that ye calle poure & mēdiaūtes / I calle thē my lordes / and I saye they be my helpers / and trust it wel y t they mowe helpe & gete me the kyngdō of heuene / And by cause he wold styre the peple to do almesse he said that whan the poure men were ones to gydre wermyng thē ayenst the sonne / they begā to telle who were good almesmen / & thē wold they •keneth mercy / he begā that same day to be mercyful in suche wise that he was called almosner / or amener / •reyse / and blame them that werr euyll / emong all other he told this narracion / Ther was somtyme a tollar named peter / in a cite / & was a moche riche mā but he was not pyteous / but cruel to poure peple / For he wold hunte & chace away poure peple & beggars frō his hous with indignacion & angre / Thus wold no poure man come to hym for almesse / Thēne was there j poure man said to his felaws what wil ye gyue me yf I gete of hym an almesse this day / And they made a wager with hym that he shold not / which don he wente to this tollars hous / & stode at the yate & demanded almesse / And whan this riche man cam / and sawe this poure man at his yate / he was moche angry / and wold haue caste somwhat at his heed but he coude fynde nothyng / tyl atte last cam one of his seruants beryng a basket ful of brede of Rye / and in a grete angre he toke a rye loof & threwe it at his hede / as he that myght not here the crye of the poure man / and he toke vp the loof & ranne to his felaws / & sayd truly that he had receyued / that loof of petres owne hande / And thēne within ij dayes after this riche man was seke & lyke for to deye / And as he laye he was rauysshed in spirite / in whiche he sawe that he was sette in Iugement / & black men bryngyng forth hys wicked deedes / & leyde them in a balaūce on that one side / And on that other side / he sawe som̄e clothed in whyte mornyng and sorouful / but they had nothyng to leye ayenst them in that other balance / And one of them said / truly we haue nothyng god ayenst hys wylle but two dayes goon / ¶ And thenne they put that loof in to that balaunce And hym semed the balances were lyke euen / ¶ Thenne they sayd to hym / Encrece and multiplye this Rye loof / or ellis thou must be deueryd to thyse blac moores or fendes / And whan he awoke / he sayd alas / yf a Rey loof haue so moche auaylled me / whiche / yaf in despite / how moche shold it haue auaylled me / yf I had gyuen all my goodes to poure men with a good will / As this riche mā wente on a day clothed with his best clothis / a poure shipmā cam to hym all naked & demanded of hym som̄e clothyng / for y e loue of god to couere hym with all / and he anon dispoylled hym self & gaf to hym his riche clothyng that he ware / & anon the poure man solde it / & whan he knewe that the poure mā had solde it / he was so sory / that he wold ete no mete / but he said Alas I am not worthy that the poure mā thynk vpon me / and the nyght folowyng whā he slepte / he sawe one brighter than y e sonne hauyng a crosse on his hede weryng the same cloth that he had gyuē to the poure man / and he said to hym why wepest y u tol And whā he had told hym the cause of his sorow / he said to hym / knowest thou this cloth / And he said / ye sire / & thēne our lord said / I haue ben clothed therwith / sith thou gauyst it to me / And I thank the of thy good will that y u haddest pite of my nakidnesse / For whā I was a cold / thou couerdest me / And whan he awoke he blessid the poure peple & said / by the lyuyng god yf I lyue / I will be one of his poure mē / And whan he had gyuē all his good to poure men / he called one of his secrete men whō he trusted wel / & said to hym I haue a secrete coūseyl to telle the / & yf y u kepe it not secrete / & doo as I bydde the I shal selle the to the hethen men / And he toke hym x poūd in gold & had hym goo in to the holy cite & bye som̄e mercerye ware / And whā thou hast so don / take me & selle me to som̄e cristen man & take that money that thou shalt resscyue for me / & gyue it to poure peple And the seruaūt refused it / and he said truly yf thou selle me not / I shal selle y e to the barbaris / And thēne he toke this peter the tollenar as he had comanded hym / which was his maister clad in vyle clothyng & ledde hym to y e market & solde hym to an Argenter for xxx besaūtes / which he toke & delte it emong poure men / This peter thēne thus sold was boūde / & put in to a kychen for to doo all fowle werkes in suche wise that he was despised of euery man of the seruantes / And som̄e ofte smote hym & knocked hym aboute the head / & called hym fool / Criste appiered ofte to hym / & shewd hym hys clothyng and the besauntes and comforted hym / And themperour and other peple were sory for the losse of peter the tollenar / And it happed that noble mē of Constantynoble cam vnto the place where as peter was for to visite holy places whom the maister of peter had to dyner / And as they satte and ete at their dyner / peter serued and passed by thē and they beholdyng hym said to eche other in theyr erres how lyke is thys yongman to peter the tollenar / and as they wel sawe and aduysed hym / they sayd verely / it is my lord peter / I shal aryse and holde hym / And whan pieres vnderstode that / he fledde away pryuely / Ther was a porter / whyche was bothe deef and dombe / And by signes he opened the yates / And peter bad hym by wordes to opene the yate / And he anone herde hym and receyuyng speche answerd hym / And peter wente hys waye / And the porter retorned in to the hows spekyng and heeryng / wherof alle they meruaylled to whom he said he that was in the kychen is goon out and fleeth away / but knowe ye for certayn that he is the seruant of god / For as he spack and bad me opene the yate / ther yssued out of hys mouth a flamme of fyre whyche touchid my tongue and myn eeres / and anon I receyued heeryng and spekyng / And anone they alle wente out and ranne after hym / but they myght not fynde hym / Thenne alle they of the hows repented them and dyde pen had so foule entreated hym / Ther was a monke named vytale whiche wold assaye yf he myght reyse ony sklaundre ayenst saynt Ioh̄n / And saynt Ioh̄n cam in to a cyte and wente vnto alle the bordelles of comyn wymen / And said to eche of them by ordre gyue me thys nyght / and doo no fornycacion / Thenne he entred in to the hous of one / & was in a corner alle the nyght on hys knees in prayer and prayd for her / And on the morn he wente and comanded to eche of thē that they shold telle it to nomā / yet one of them manyfested hys lyf And anon as saynt Ioh̄n had prayd she began to be tormented with a deuyll And anon the other wymen said to her / god hath gyuen to the / that / that thou hast deserued / by cause she entred for to doo fornycacion / and not for none other cause / ¶ And whan it was euen the forsaid monke vytale said to fore them all / I wyll goo theder / For that woman abydeth me / thenne many blamed hym / And he answerd & said / am I not a man as another is I haue a body as other men haue / Is god only wroth wyth monkis / they be men as other be / Thenne som̄e of them said to hym / Take to the a wyf and chaūge thyn habite / so that thou sklaūdre not other / he faynyng hym self wroth said / veryly I shal not here you who that wyl be sklaundrd / late hym be sklaūdred and late hym smyte his forhede ayenst the walle / be ye ordeyned to be my Iuges of god / Goo ye and take heed of your self / For ye shal gyue none acomptes for me / And thys he said with a lowde voys / And then ne they complayned to saynt Ioh̄n of hys gouernaunce / Our lord harded so the herte that he gaf no credence to his wordes / but prayd god that he wold shewe hys werkes to som̄e creature after his deth / And that it sholde not torne hym to synne that defamed hym / by thys meane he brought many for to be conuerted / And sette of them many for to be closed in religyon / In a morenyng as he wente fro them / one of thyes comyn wymen mett wyth a man that entred in for to doo fornycacion / whom he gaf a buffette and sayd thou wycked man why amendest thou not thy wycked lyuyng / and he said to hym / byleue me right wel that thou shalt haue suche a buffet / that alle alysaūdre shal assemble to wondre on the / And after that the fende cam in lyknes of a man / and yaf hym a buffete and said to hym / thys is the buffet that thabbot vytale promysed the / and anon he was rauysshyd wyth the fende and tormented / so that all the peple drewe to hym and wondred on hym / but atte last he was repentaunt / And was heled by the prayers of saynt vytale / And whan the seruaunt of god was nygh hys ende / he lefte in wrytyng to hys dyscyples / Iugge ye neuer byfore the tyme / And whan he was deeed the wymen confessyd what he had don / And all they gloryfyed god / And namely saynt Ioh̄n sayeng / wold god that thy had taken / Ther was a poure man in thabyte of a pylgryme cam to saynt Ioh̄n and demanded almesse / And he callyd hys dyspenser and bad hym to gyue to that poure man vj pens / whyche he receyued and wente hys waye / and chaunged his clothyng / and cam agayn to the patriarke and asked almesse / And he callyd hys dyspenser / and bad hym to gyue hym vj pens of gold / And whan he had gyuen to hym and was departed / the dyspenser said to hys lord Fader at your request / thys man hath receyued twyes almesse thys day / and hath chaunged his habyte twies / saynt Ioh̄n fayned as he had not herd it / And the poure man chaunged his clothyng the thyrde tyme / and cam agayn to saynt Ioh̄n and asked yet the thyrd tyme almesse / And thenne the dyspenser told hys lord pryuely that he was the same beggar / to whom saynt Ioh̄n sayde / yeue to hym xij besaūtes / leste it be my lord Ihesu cryst that wyll preue me whether he myht more take / or I yeue / ¶ On a tyme it happed that one patricius had certayn money of the chyrche whyche he wold put in marchaundyse / but the patriarke wold in no wyse consente therto / but wold it shold be gyuen to poure peple / And they coude not acorde / but departed all wroth / And after euensong tyme the patryarke sente to tharchepreste patricius sayeng Syr the sonne is nygh goō doun / And he heryng that / anon he wepte and cam to hym and asked for yeuenes / ¶ On a tyme the neuew of the patryarke suffred wronge of a tauerner / And complayned lamentably to the patriarke and coude not be comforted / ¶ And the patriarke said to hym / who is so hardy that dar saye ayenst the / or opene hys mouth ayenst the / Byleue me sone that I shal thys day do for the suche a thyng that alle Alisaundre shal wondre on it / And And whan he herde that / he was wel conforted wenyng that the tauerner shold haue ben sore beten / And saynt Ioh̄n seeyng tha comforted / kyssed hys breste and said / Sone yf thou be veryly the neuew of myn humylyte / make the redy to be scorgid & to suffre of euery man betyngis / chydyngis and wronges / For veray affynyte is not only of flesshe and blood but it is knowe by the strengthe of vertue / And anone he sente for that mā and made hym free of alle pension and tribute / And all they that herd thys wondred gretly / And thenne vnderstode they that he had said byfore / that he wold so doo that all alysaūdre shold wondre therof / The patriarke herynge of the custome that is whan themperour is crowned / ther shal come to hym the makers of sepultures and brynge stones of marble of dyuerse colours / and demande themperour of what stones he wyl haue hys graue made or of what metalle / Saynt Ioh̄n remembryng thys comanded to make hys sepulture but yet he dyde not do make it alle / but lefte it vnparfyght vnto hys ende / And he ordeyned that at euery feste whan he was wyth the clergye / som̄e shold come to hym and saye / Syre thy monument or sepulture is not all made but Imperfyght / comande that it may be made / For thou wotest not what hour thou shalt dye / ne whan the theef cometh / ¶ There was a riche man whych sawe saynt Ioh̄n hauyng in his and not riche / For he had gyuen all hys good to poure men / he bought for hym a moche riche couertour for hys bedde / and yaue it to saynt Ioh̄n / And in a nyght as it laye vpon hym he coude not slepe / For he thoughte iijC of hys lordes myght wel haue be couerd wyth alle / and made all that nyght moche lamentacion seyeng / A lord how many ben there of my lordes now in the myre / how many in the rayn / how many so colde that theyr teeth beten to gydre / And how many that slepen in the market place / and sayd to hym self / and thou wretche deuourest the grete fysshes and restest in thy chambre wyth thy wickednesse vnder a couertour of xxvj pound to warme thy carayn / And after he wold neuer be couerd therwyth / but on the morn he dyde do selle it / & gaf the money therof to poure peple / And whan the ryche man sawe it / he bought it agayn / and toke it to the blessyd saynt Ioh̄n and desyred hym no more to selle it / but kepe it for hym self / And anon after saynt Ioh̄n solde it agayn / and gaf the money of hit to poure peple / And whan the riche mā wyst it / yet he bought it agayn and brought it to saynt Ioh̄n ful goodly & said to hym / we shal see who shal fayll of vs / or thou in the sellyng or I in the byeng / & thus it was ofte bought and solde / The riche man seeyng wel that he myght well mynusshe his richesse in this maner without synne to thentente to yeue it to poure peple / And they bothe shold wynne in thys maner / that one in sauyng of theyr soules / And that other in getyng reward / and saynt Ioh̄n wold drawe men to doo almesse / in thys maner / he was acustomed to telle of saynt serapion / whan he had gyue hys mantel to a poure man / And after mette wyth another that had colde / he gaf hym hys cote / And hym self satte al naked / And one demaunded of hym / Fader who hath despoylled the / And he had in hys honde the book of theuangelies / & said thys hath dyspoylled me / And anon he sawe another poure man / and thenne he solde the book of gospellis & gaf the prys therof to poure men / And whan he was demāded where hys book of the gospellis was / he answerd & said that the gospel comādeth and saith Goo and selle all that thou hast / and gyue it to the poure / I had thys gospell and I haue solde it / lyke as he comandeth / On a tyme he gaf to a poure man v besauntes / And the poure man had desdayn therof and began to chyde / and dyspyse hym in hys visage / by cause he had nomore almesse / And whan hys struantes sawe that / they wold haue beten hym / And thēne the blessyd Iohan deffended them sayeng / suffre ye hym brethern and late hym curse me / loo I haue thys lx yere blasphemed by my werkys Cryst / and may not I not bere one blame or vice of thys man / And he comanded that a sack of money full / shold be brought / to fore thys poure man that he shold take as moche as he world / On a tyme after that the gospell was redde in the chyrche the peple wente out and talked ydle tales / And thys holy patriarke apperceyued them / and folowed after and satte doun emong them / and said to them / Sones there as the sheep been / there must the sheepherde be also / And therfor eyther ye muste entre with me in to the chyrche / or ellys I must abyde wyth you here / And thus he dyde tweyes / And therby he taught the peple to abyde & stande in the chyrche / Another tyme ther was a yongman had rauysshed anonne / And the clerkys repreued the yong man therof to fore saynt Ioh̄n / And said he ought to be cursid therfor by cause he had lost ij sowles / his owne and the nonnes / Thenne saynt Iohan withstode theyr sentence sayeng / not so my sones not so / I shal shewe to you that ye cōmyse two synnes / Fyrst ye doo ayenst the comandement of god whyche saith Iuge ye not / and ye shal not be Iuged / Secondly ye wyte not for certayn whether they haue synned in to thys day / and haue not be penytent / and haue repented them It fyll many tymes that saynt Ioh̄n was rauysshyd in hys prayers and was in a traunce / And he was herd dyspute with our lord / in thyse wordes / So good lord Ihesu cryst so / I in partyng and thou in mynystryng / late vs see who shal ouercome / On a tyme whan he was seek & vexid wyth the feures and sawe that he approched hys ende / he said / I yelde to the thankynges / For thou hast herd my wretchidnes prayeng thy goodnes that at my deth shold be foūde wyth me but one besaunt / or one pece of money / and that yet I comande to be gyuen to the poure / And thenne he yelded hys soule vnto all myghty god / And his venerable body was put in a sepulcre where the bodyes of ij bysshoppis were buryed / And the two bodyes by myracle gaf rome and place to the body of saynt Ioh̄n / For they remeued eche fro other / and left the mydle voyde for his body / A lityl tyme to fore hys deth ther was a woman had cōmysed a grete and horryble synne / And durst not be shryuen therof ne bad here wryte hit and seale it / and brynge it to hym / And he wold praye for her / she assented therto / she wrote her synne / and dylygently closed and sealed it / And delyuerd it to saynt Ioh̄n / And anon after saynt Ioh̄n waxe seek and deyde And whan she herd that he was deed she supposed her self confused and shamed / For she wende that he hath delyuerd it to som̄e other man / and she cam to hys tombe / and there wepte & cryed moche lamentably sayeng / Alas Alas I supposed to haue eschewid my cōfusion / & now I am made confusion vnto all other / & wepte bytterly prayeng saynt Ioh̄n that he wold shewe to here where he had lefte her wrytyng / & And sodenly saynt Ioh̄n cam and appiered to her in thabyte of a bysshop / on eyther syde of hym a bysshop / and said to the woman / why troblest thou me so moche and thies sayntes wi and suffrest not vs to haue reste / loo here our clothes ben alle weet of thy teeris / And thenne delyuerd to her her scrowe agayn sealed as it was to fore sayeng to her / Se here thy seall / opene thy wrytyng and rede it / whyche anō she opened / and all her synne was disfaced and clene out / and she fonde therin wreton / Alle thy synne is foryeuen / and put away by the prayer of Ioh̄n my seruaunt / And thenne she rendred thākynges to our lord god and to saynt Ioh̄n / And thenne saynt Ioh̄n with the two bysshoppis retorned in to theyr sepulture / Thys holy man saynt Ioh̄n flowrid in the yere of our lord vjCv in the tyme of foke themperour / •ut a Rye loof which he gaf to •nar / •unce / by cause they •ke buffet that he toke / I • he was •edde but vyle clothes •hewe it to noman saynt Ioh̄n •h me Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Iohan the Almosner Of the conuersion of saynt paule & of the name of conuersion COnuersion is sayd of conuertor / I am torned / or is as moche as to gydre torned from synnes and euyllis / he is not conuerted that shryueth hym to y e preest of one synne and hydeth an other / It is said conuersion / For saynt paule thys day was conuerted to the fayth leuyng hys vices / why he is said paule / it shal be said afterward / ¶ Of the conuersion of saynt Paule THe conuersion of saynt Paule was made the same yere that cryste suffred hys passion / and saynt stephen was stoned also / not in the yere naturell but appieryng / For our lord suffred deth the viij kalendes of apryll And saynt stephen suffred deth the same yere the thyrde day of august / And was stoned and saynt paule was conuerted / the viij kalendis of feuerer / And thre reasons ben assigned wherfor the conuersion of saynt paule is halowed more than of other saynctes / Fyrst for thensample / by cause that no synnar what someuer he be shold despayre of pardon / whan he seeth hym that was in so grete synne / to be in so grete Ioye / Secondly for the Ioye / For lyke as the chyrche had grete so had she grete Ioye in his conuersion / Thyrdly for the myracle that our lord shewde / whan of j so cruel a persecutour was made so trewe a prechour / The conuersion of hym was merueyllous by reson of hym that made hym / and of hym that ordeyned hym / and of the pacient that suffred it / by reson of hym that made hym to be conuerted / that was Ihesu cryst / whyche shewde there his merueillous puyssaunce / in that he said / it is harde to the to stryue ayenst the alle or prycke / and in that / he chaunged hym so sodaynly / For anon as he was chaunged he said / lord what wylt y u that I doo / vpon thys word sayth saynt Austyn / the lambe slayn of the wulues / hath made of a wulf a lambe / For he was redy for to obeye / that to fore was wood for to persecute / Secondly he shewd hys merueyllous wysedom / hys merueyllous wysedom was in that / that he toke fro hym the swellyng of pryde / in offryng to hym the inward thynges of humylyte / and not the heyghte of mageste / For he said I am Ihesus of nazareth / And he called not hym self / god ne the sone of god / but he said to hym / take thynfirmytees of humanyte / and caste away the squames of pryde / Thyrdly he shewde hys pyteous debonayrte and mercy / whyche is signefied in that / that he that was in dede and in wylle to persecute / he conuerted / how be it he had euyl wyll / as he that desyred alle the menaces and thretenynges / & had euyll purpoos / as he that wente to the prynce of preestis / as he that had a Ioye in hys euyl werkis / that he ladde the crysten men bounden to Iherusalem / And therfor hys Iourneye and vyage was right euyll / And yet neuertheles the mercy of god conuerted / Secondly the conuersion was merueyllous of hym that ordeyned it that is of the lyght that he ordeyned in hys conuersion / And it is said that thys lyght was dispositif / sodayne / and celestyall / And thys light of heuen aduyronned hym sodeynly / Poule had in hym thre vices / the first was hardynesse / whych is noted whā it is said / that he wente to the prynce of the prestes / And as the glose sayth not called / but by hys owen wyll & enuye that enticed hym / The second was pryde / and that is signefyed by that he desired and sighed the menaces and thretenyngis / The thyrd was thentente carnall & the vnderstandyng that he had in the lawe / wherof the glose saith vpon that worde / I am Ih̄ūs & cetera / I god of heuene speke / the whyche thou supposest to be deed / by the consente of the Iewes / ¶ And thys lyght dyuyne was sodeyne / It was grete and out mesure for to throwe don̄ hym that was hye and proude in to the dyche or pytte of humanyte / It was celestyal / by cause it torned and chaūged hys flesshely vnderstondyng in to celestyall / Or it may be said that this ordenaunce or dysposicion was in thre thynges / that is to wete in the voys cryeng / in the light shynyng / and in the vertue of puyssaunce / Thyrdly it was merueyllous by the vertue of the souffryng of the pacyent that is of poule in whom the conuersion was made / For thyes thre thynges were made in hym without forth merueyllously / that is to wyte that he was beten to therthe / he was blynde / & fasted iij dayes & was smeton doun to the ground for to be reysed / & saynt austyn sayth he was smeton doun for to be blynde for to be chaunged and for to be sente / he was sente to suffre deth for trouthe / And yet saith saynt Austyn / he that was out of the fayth was hurte for to be made bileue / the persecutor was hurt to be made a prechour / the sone of perdicion was hurt / for to be made the vessell of election / And was made blynde for to be enlumyned / And thys was as touchyng hys derke vnderstandyng Thenne in the iij dayes that he abode thus blynde / he was lerned & enformed in the gospell / For he lerned it neuer of man ne by mā / as he hym self witnesseth but by the reuelacion of I And saynt Austyn sayth thus / I saye that seynt poule was the very champion of Ihesu cryst taught of hym redressed of hym / crucyfyed with hym / and gloryous in hym / he was made lene in hys flessh / that hys flessh shold be dysposid to theffecte of good operacion / And fro thenne forthon hys body was establyssed and desposed to all good / he coude wel suffre hungre / and habondaunce / and was informed and instructe in all thynges / And all aduersitees he gladly suffred / crisostom̄ sayth he ouercam tormentours / tyraūtes and peple full of woodnesse / lyke as flyes / And the deth / the tormentes / and all the paynes that myght be don to hym / he counted thē but as the p embraced wyth a good wyll / And he was ennobled in hym self to be bounde in a strōge chayne more than to be crowned with a crowne / And receyued more gladly strokes / and woundes than other yeftes / And it is red that in hym were thre thyngis / aynest the thre that were in our formest fader adam / for adam erected and adressid hym ayenst god our lord / And in saynt poule was contrarye / For he was throwē doun to the erthe / In adam was thopenyng of hys eyen / and poule was in the contrarye / made blynde / and adam ete of the fruyt deffended / And saynt poule contrarye was abstynent of cou •owe in hys persecucion / So ••su cryst / •aye of chyldren ¶ Alle them he •nable mete / Thus endeth the conuersion of saynt poule Here foloweth of saynt pawlyne the wydowe SAynt pawlyne was a moche noble wydowe of rome / of whome saynt Iherome wrote the lyf / and sayth fyrst thus / yf alle my membres were torned in to tongues / And alle my Arteryes shold resowne in humayne voys / yet I myght not worthyly wryte the vertues of saynt paulyne / I take wytnesse of god and of hys holy angellis / and also of thaungel that wa nothyng for preysyng / but tha good & puyssaunt of seygnorye at Rome / She was the most humble of all other / For lyke as the sonne surmounteth the clerenes of the sterres / so surmounted she the bounte of other by her grete humylyte / whan her husbond was passed out of thys world she abode lady of all the goodes and Rychesse / It happed that atte mandement of themperour many bysshoppis cam to Rome / emonge whom were there the holy man paulynus the patryarke of Anthyoche / And Epiphanus bysshop of cypre / of whom she was esprysed in good vertues so y t she gaf largely of her goodes for goddes sake / her parentes / ne her frendes / ne her owne chyldren / coude not torne her ne to make her to chaunge her purpose / but that she wold become the pilgryme of Ihesu cryst / For thamerous desyre that she had to Ihesu cryst surmoūted the loue that she had to her chyldren / Onely emong all her chyldren she had put her affectiō in eustochiū her doughter / whome she lad wyth her in thys pylgremage / She toke the see / and saylled so ferre that she cam in to the holy lande of Iherusalem / O how grete deuocion she had to vysyte the holy sepulcre / of Ihesu cryst / and the other holy places / and how all wepyng she kyssed them / ther can noman reherce alle / Alle the cyte of Iherusalem coude speke of it / And yet best of alle knewe the lorde / for whos loue she had forsaken all thynge / She had be at rome so puyssaunt and so noble / that euery man coueyted to doo to her honour / for her grete renōmee / but she that was foūded vpon humylyte sought the hūble places and relygions / and cam atte laste to bethleem / And whan she had deuoutly vysyted the place / in whych the vyrgyne marye enfaunted and childed Ihesu cryst she fyll in a vysion / And as she sware to me / that she sawe in that vision the chyld wrapped in poure clowtes lyeng in the cribbe or in the racke / and how the thre kynges worshipped hym / how the sterre cam vpon the hows / and how the shepherdes cam to see hym / and how herodes made persecucion vpon the Innocentis / and how Ioseph bare the chyld in to egypte / And thys vysion she said alle in wepyng and in lawhyng / and sayd I salewe the bethleem wherin he is born that descended fro heuen / Of the prophesyed mychee the xv chapytre / That of the shold be born the god that shold gouerne the peple of Israhel / And the lygnage of dauid shold endure in the / vnto the tyme that the gloryous virgyne shold enfaunte Iesu cryst / and I wretched as vnworthy to repute me to kysse the crybbe / in whyche our lord wepte as a chyld / and the vyrgyne chylded / here I shal take my reste and my dwellyng / For my sauyour chaas thys place in bethleem / She made there her habytacion wyth many vyrgynes that serued god / And how wel that she was lady of all / neuertheles she was the most humble and meke in spekyng in habyte / and in goyng / in suche wise that she semed seruant of all the other / She neuer ete after the deth of her husbond wyth noman / how good that he was / she vysited as it is sayd to fore all the holy places and the monkes of Egypte / emong whome were many of the auncyent fadres and many holy men / And her semed that she sawe Isesu cryst emong them / And after she founded in bethleem an abbaye in whyche she assembled virgynes / as wel of noble estate as of myddle and lowe lygnage / And departed them in thre congregacions / so that they were departed in werke / in mete and drynk but in sayeng theyr psaultier and adouryng were they to gydre atte houres as it apperteyned / And she enduced and enformed all the other in prayer & in werke by ensample gyuyng / She was neuer ydle / And alle And they had no shetes / ne lynnen cloth but to drye their handes / And they myght haue no lycence to speke to men / And them that cam late to the houres / she blamed debonayrly or sharply after that they were and suffred not that ony of them shold haue ony thyng saue the lyuyng and clothyng / for to put away auaryce / fro them / She appeased them swetely that stroof / And also she brake and mortyfyed emong the yong maydens / theyr flesshly desyres / by contynuel fastynges / For she had leuyr haue them good suffryng sorowe and sekenes / than their herte shold be hurte by flesshly wyll And she chastysed them that were nyce and queynte / sayeng that suche nycete was fylthe of the sowle / and said also / that a word sownyng to ony ordure or fylthe shold neuer yssue out of y e mouth of a virgyne / For by the wordes outward is shewd the countenaunce of y e herte within / and she that so spack and was rebuked therfor / yf she amended it not at the first warnyng / ne atte second / ne atte the thyrd / she shold be dysseueryd fro the other in etyng and in drynkyng / by whych she shold be asshamed / And thus shold be amended by debonayr correction / and yf she wold not / she shold be punysshyd by ryght grete moderaciō / She was merueyllous debonayr & pyteous / to them that were seke / and comforted them and serued them ryght besily / And gaf to thē largely to ete suche as they asked / but to her self she was hard in her sekenes & skarce / For she refused to ete flessh / how wel she gaf it to other / & also to drynke wyn / She was ofte by them that were seke / and leyde the pylowes a ryght & in poynt / And froted theyr feet / and chauffed water to wasshe them / And her semed that the lasse she dyde to the seke in seruyse / so moche lasse seruyse dyde she to god and deserued lasse meryte / And therfor she was to them pyetous / and nothyng to her self / In her right grete sekenesses she wold haue no softe bede / but laye vpon the str ground / and toke but lityl reste / For the most parte she was in prayers bothe by day and by nyght / & she wepte so moc semed of her eyen a fontayne / so And whan we sayd to her oftymes that she shold kepe her eyen fro wepyng so moche / she sayd the vysage ought to be lyke to be fowl / by cause it hath so moche be made fayr and gay ayenst the comandement of god / And the body ought to be chastised / that hath had so moche solas in thys world / & the lawhyngis ought to be recompensed by wepyngis / And the softe bedde and the shetis ought to be chaūgyd in to the sharpnes of hayer / I that was acustomed to pleyse man and the world / I desyre now to pleyse Ihesu cryst / And what shal I saye of chastete / in which she was example / vnto all ladyes of tyme passed / whan she was yet seculyer For she conuersed in suche wyse / that they that were enuyous durst not auyse on her ony euyl fame / she was debonayr and curtoys / vnto all / For she cōforted the poure / and warned the ryche / to doo wel / but in largesse she passed so / that n And thys dyde she not by the grete habundance that she had of goodes but by her wyse gouernaunce / and whan I said to her that she shold haue mesure in doyng almesse / after that the appostle sayth / that thalmesse that is doon to another / be not greuous to hym that doth it / But she said that for the loue of our lord she dyde all / And that she desyred to deye beggyng / in suche wyse that she shold not leue one peny to her doughter after her / And that she myght be wrapped in a strange shete whan she shold deye / And atte last she sayd / yf I shold demande ought / I shold fynde ynough that wold gyue to me / And thyes beggars yf I gaf to them nought / and they so departed and deyde for pouerte / Of whom shold god demaunde thys / Ofte sayd she se And almesse quenchyth sy theyr carnalytees / they seme to be good without forth / but within they be mortall paulyne was not suche one she affebled her body right sore / in fastyng & in labour vnnethe she sette her eyen to her etyng fysshe / ne mylke / egges or whyte mete / in whyche many wene to doo grete abstynence / without etyng flessh / For our lord gaf to her an aduersarye / the stymulacion flesshly / by which she held her in humylyte wythout sauouryng ony thyng of pryde for the foyson of her vertues / And also that she thought not to be heyer than other wymen / She had alleway in her mynde the holy scriptures ayenst the deceyuaunces of the frend / And specyally thys that moys saith / god assayeth you / yf he loue you / And this that ysaye sayth the prophete / ye that haue be atte solas and Ioyes of the world / and now be withdrawen fro them and lefte them / loke after none other thyng / but to suffre tribulacion vpon trybulacion / And knowe ye by tribulacion is had pacience / And by pacience is had pouerte / It is said Iob primo capl̄o / whan it was shewd to hym the losse of his patrymonye / he answerd I yssued nakyd fro the bely of my moder / And I shal reentre nakyd agayn in to therthe / lyke as god may be plesyd / so be it doon / hys name be preysed and blessyd / he lerned vs that we shold not loue the world / For the world shal fynysshe in her couetyse / whan one told her that her chyldren were right seke / she sayd / who loueth his sone or hys doughter more thā god is not worthy to be with god / A man that semed to be her frende / sente her word on a tyme / that she had grete nede to kepe wel her brayne / For by cause of thardeur that she had in vertues she semed to be out of her witte And she answerd / In thys world we be reputed as fooles for the loue of Ihesu cryst / And our lord said to his appostles / the world hateth you / For ye be not of the world / yf ye were of the world that is to saye of the conuersion of the world / the world shold loue you / Fayr lord god we mortyfye our self allewaye / and we be reputed as sheep that be brought to deth / by cau playnyng we mortefye our bodyes / In suche pacience was she vnto the deth / and suffred humbly thenuye of them that were euyll / She had in her mynde the holy scriptures / And she helde her more to the spyrituel vnderstondyng than to thystoryes of the scripture / She coude parfyghtly hebrewe / greke latyn & frensshe / and redde coursably the scriptures in thyse foure langages / who may recounte wythout wepyng the deeth of this woman / She fylle in a maladye mortall / and sawe wel that she shold deye / For all her body bycam cold / And she felte that her spirite helde her in her brest / Thenne said she wythout playnyng / and with out hauyng ony charge sauf to god / Fayr swete lord I haue coueyted the beaute of thy hous for to be in thyn habytacion / that is so fayr / My sowle hath desired to be in thy Royame / And whā I demaunded her wherfor she spack nomore / And she wold not answere me and I asked yf she suffred grete payne / she said to me in grekis tongue that she was wel and in good peas / And anone she lefte spekyng te me and closed her eyen in sayeng / to god / Lord lyke as the herte desireth to come to the fontayne / so desireth my sowle to come to the / Alas whan shal I come to the / fayr lord god / And in sayeng thyse wordes she made a crosse vpō her mouth There were bysshoppis / prestes / clerkes chanones / and monkes wythout nombre / And atte laste whan she herd her spowse Ihesu cryst whyche callid her sayeng / Aryse and come to me my swete loue and fayr espowse / For the wynter is passed / she answerd gladly / the flowres ben shewde in our contrey / And I byleue that I shal see the goodes in the Royame of heuene of my lord Ihesu cryst / And thus she rendred her sowle and passed out of thys world / And anone all the congregaciō of vyrgynes made no crye in wepyng as don y e peple of the world / but redde deuoutly their psaltier / not only vnto the tyme that she was buryed / but all y e day & all the nyght / & with grete payne coude not Eustochiū her venerable doughter the virgyne be withdrawē fro her / but she kyssed her and embraced her

wyse in reputacion of hym self / SAynt Iulyen was bysshop of cenomanence / It is said that it was he that was said Symō the lepre wham our lord heled of hys mesel and bad Ihesu cryst to dyner / And after thascencion of our lord he was ordeyned of thappostles bysshop of Emaus / full of grete vertues / he appyered to the world he reysed thre dede mē and after he ended hys dayes in grete preysyng of god / Of thys saynt Iulyen som̄e saye / that this is he that pylgryms and weyfaryng men calle and requyre for good herberowe / by cause our lord was lodged in hys hows / but it semeth better that it is he that slewe hys fader and moder ignoraūtly / of whom thystorye is here after / Ther was another Iulyen born in almayne / whyche was of noble lygnage / and yet more noble in fayth and in vertue / whyche for the grete desire that he had to be martir / he offrid hym self to the tyrauntis where he had not forfayted / Now it happed that crispmus whyche was one of the gouernours of rome sente to hym one of hys mynystres for to put hym to deth / anon as the mynystre cam to hym / he yssued out of hys place / And cam to fore hym / And offred to hym to suffre deth And hys heed was smeten of / And they toke the hede and shewde it to saynt Feryel that was hys felowe / And sayd they wold so doo of hym / yf he sacrefyed not / And by cause he wold not obeye to them / they slewe hym / And toke the heed of saynt Iulyen and the body of saynt Feryoll / and buryed them bothe in one pytte / And a grete whyle after saynte mamertyne bysshop of vyane / fonde the heed of saynt Iulyen bytwene the handes of saynt feryol also hoole as it had be buryed that same day / ¶ the other myracles of saynt Iulyen it is •mong said that a deken toke alle the whyte sheep that were of the chyrche of saynt Iulyen / And the shepherdes defended them / but he sayd to them that saynt Iulyen ete neuer no moto And anon after a feuer toke hym so grete and hooot / that he knowleched that he was of the martir so

themperour graunted them / And wrote that all men shold obeye them and helpe them vpon payne to lose their hedes / Now it happed that they edefyed a chirche / and all men by the comandement of themperour obeyed and heelp them ¶It happed that there were som̄e men that ladde a carte whyche shold passe by / and thought how they myght doo and passe without arestyng for to helpe them / they thoughte that one of thē shold lye on the carte / as he were deed And therby they wold excuse them / And so they dyde / and bad hym that laye in the carte to holde his eyen cloos tyl they were passed

not For they caryed a dede man / Saynt Iulien said to them / why lye ye so / they answerd / Syre we lye not / it is soo as we saye to you / And saynt Iulyen sayd to them / so mote falle to you as ye saye / And anon they droof forth theyr oxen and passed forth And whan they were passed a lytyl / they called theyr felawe / that he shold aryse and dryue forth the oxen / for to goo the faster / And he answerd not one word And they called hym agayn on hye and sayd / art thou out of thy wytte / aryse vp and dryue forth the beestys / and he meued ne spack not one worde / They wente vp and dyscoueryd hym and fonde hym dede / as saynt Iulyen had sayd to them / Thenne toke they suche drede and fere that after that / they ne none otheer that herd of the myracle durste ly nomore to fore the holy seruaunt of god / Another Iulyen ther was that slewe hys fader and moder by ygnouraūce / And thys man was noble and yong and gladly wente for to hunte / And one tyme emonge all other he fonde an herte whyche retorned to ward hym / and said to hym / thou huntest me that shalt slee thy fader & moder / herof was he moche abasshed and aferd / And for drede that it shold not happen to hym / that the herte had sayd to hym / he wente pryuely away that noman knewe therof And fonde a prynce noble and grete / to whome he put hym in seruyse / And he preued so wel in bataylle / and in seruices in hys palays / that he was so moche in the prynces grace that he made hym knyght / And gaf to hym a ryche wydowe of a Castell / and for her doware he receyued the castell / And whan hys fader and moder knewe / that he was thus goon / they put hem in the waye for to seke hym in many places / And so longe they wente / tyl they cam to the castel where he dwelled / but thenne he was goon out / and they fonde hys wyf / And whan she sawe them she enquyred dylygently who they were / And whan they had sayd and recounted what was happend of theyr sone / she knewe veryly that they were the fader and moder of theyr husbonde / And receyuyd them moche charytably / And gaf to them her owne bedde / And made another for her self / And on the morn the wyf of Iulyen wente to the chyrche And her husbond come home whyles she was at chyrche / And entred in to hys chambre for to awake his wyf / And he sawe tweyne in his bedde / And had wende that it had ben a man that had leyen wyth his wif / And slewe them bothe wyth his swerd / ¶ And after wente out and sawe his wyf comyng fro chyrche Thenne he was moche abasshed / and demanded of his wyf who they were that laye in his bedde / thenne she said that they were hys fader and hys moder / whyche had longe sought hym / And she had leyed them in hys bedde / ¶ Thenne he swowned and was almost deed / And began to wepe bytterly and crye / Alas caytyf that I am

that I shal haue knwleche / yf god wylle pardone and foryeue me thys that I haue don and that I shal haue worthy penaunce therfore / And she answerd Ryght dere loue god forbede that ye shold goo wythout me / lyke as I haue had Ioye wyth you / so wyl I haue payne and heuynesse / Thenne departed they / and wente tyl they cam to a grete ryuer / ouer whyche moche folk passed / where they edeffyed an hospytall moche grete for to herberowe poure peple / And ther doo theyr penaunce / in beryng men ouer that wold passe / After longe tyme saynt Iulyen slepte aboute mydnyght sore traueylled and it was frozn / and moche colde / And he herd a voys lamentyng and cryeng that said / Iulien come / and helpe vs ouer / And anon he aroos and wente ouer and fonde one almost deed for colde / and anon he toke hym and bare hym to the fyre / and dyde grete laboure to chauffe and warme hym / And whan he sawe that he coude not be chaufed ne warme / he bare hym in to hys bedde / and couerd hym the best wyse he myght / And anon after he that was so seke and appiered as he had be meselle he sawe all shynyng assendyng in to heuen / and said to saynt Iulien hys hoost / Iulien oure lorde hath sente me to the / and sendeth the worde / that he hath accepted thy penaunce / And a whyle after seynt Iulien & hys wyf rendrid vnto god their soules & departed out of this world / Another Iulien ther was but he was no saynct / but a cursed man and was called Iulianus apostata / Thys Iulyen was first a monke / and shewyng out ward signes of grete religion and of grete holynesse / after that that mayster Iohan beleth reciteth / Ther was a woman that had thre pottes ful of gold And by cause the gold shold not be seyn / she had put in the mouth of the potte abouen asshes / And delyuerd them to thys Iulien to fore other monkes for to kepe / whom she reputed an holy man / but she said not to hym that they were ful of gold / whan he had thyse pottes he loked what was therin and he fond that it was gold / and toke it out all / And fylle them ful of asshes / And fledde wyth all to Rome / And dyde so moche that he was of the counceyllours and gouernours of Rome / But the woman whan she wold haue a gayn her pottes / she coude not preue that she had delyueryd to hym / in kepyng gold / For she made no mēcion therof to fore the monkes / And therfor he reteyned it / and procured wyth all thoffyce of a consul of the gouernaunce of Rome / And after that he procured somoche that he was instytued emperour / whylis he was yong he was taught in the arte of enchauntement and of thynuocacions of feendes / And gladly he studyed and it plesed hym moche / and had wyth hym dyuerse maystres of that science / Now it happed on a day that as hys maistre was oute / he began allone to rede thynuocacions / And a grete multitude of feendis cam aboute hym and made hym aferd / and he made the signe of the crosse and anon they vanysshed away / And whā his maistre was retorned he told hym what was happend to hym / but his maistre said to hym / y t alleway he had hated & fered that signe / whan thēne he was emperour / he remēbrid the rof / & by cause he wold vse the craft of deuyll / ouerall where he fonde y e signes of the crosse / he destroyed thē / & persecuted crysten men / by cause that he knewe well / that otherwyse the feendes wold not doo for hym / Now it happed that he descended in to a regyon that is called perside / And fro thens he sente in to thoccident / a deuyl for to haue answere of that he sayd to hym / And this deuyl wente / & abode x dayes in one place wythout meuyng by cause ther was a monke contynuelly in prayer nyght & day / And whan he myght not doo / he retorned / Thenne Iulien demanded hym / where he had ben so longe he answerd / I haue ben in a place where I fonde a monke nyght & daye prayeng / And I supposed to haue troubled hym that he shold nomore pray And all this whyle I coude neuer torne hym fro his prayer / And thus I am retorned wythout doyng ony thyng / Thenne Iulien thapostata had grete Indignacion / & sayd whan he cam thider / he wold auenge hym of the monke / And whan he wente in to perse / the deuylles promysed hym y t he shold haue victorye of a cyte / The maister of enchantemens whyche deuyned by the deuyl for hym said to a crysten man / what dooth the smythis sone / he said y t he made a sepulture for Iulyen his maistre / and as it is redde

saith thre thyngis make a man holy / whyche thre were parfyghtly in her / that is clennesse of herte / the presence of the holy ghoost / and plente of good maners / or she is sayd of a whyche is to

ledyng a pure and holy lyf / Quyncyen the prouost of Secyle beyng of a lowe lygnage was lecherous / Auaricious and a mes And for taccōplysshe hys euyl desyris flesshly and to haue richesses / dyde do take saynt Agathe to be presented and brought to fore hym / And began to beholde her wyth a lecherous sight / And for to haue her hym self / he wold haue enduced her to make sacrefyse vnto the ydolles / And whan he sawe her ferme in her purpoos / he put her in the kepyng of a woman named affrodysse / whyche had ix doughters ouer foule lyke vnto the moder / Thys dyde he for to enduce saynt Agathe to doo hys wyll wythin xxx dayes / Affrodysse and her doughters entreted the holy virgyne to consente to the wyll of the prouoste / And somtyme they made to her grete promysses of temporell goodes / and of grete eases / And somtyme they made to her menaces of greuous tormentes / for to suffre and grete paynes / to which saynt Agathe answerd frely / My courage & my thought ben so fermly founded vpon the ferme stone of Ihesu cryst that for no payne it may not be chaunged / your wordes ben but wynde / your promesses ben but Rayne / And your menaces ben as ryuers that passe / And how wel y t all thyse thyges hurtle atte foundement of my courage / yet for that it shal not moeue / In this maner answerd she / and alleway wepte in makyng her prayers / and moche grete desyre had she to come to Ihesu cryst by martirdom and by tormentis / whan affrodysse sawe wel / that in no wyse she wold be mo she wente to the prouost quyncianus / •uyd and said to hym Sonner shold the stones wexe softe / &

hym in Iugement / And demaunded her of her lygnage / And atte laste he wold constrayne her to make sacrefyse vnto thydolles / And saynt Agathe answerd that they were no goddes / but were deuylles that were in thydollys made of marble and of wood and ouergylte / Qunncianus said chese one of two / or doo sacrefyse to our goddes / or thou shall suffre payne and tormentes / Saynt Aghate sayd / thou sayst that they be goddes / by cause thy wyf was such one as was venus thy goddesse / and thou thy self as Jupyter / whyche was an homycide and euyll / Quyncyanus sayd it appyereth wel that thou wylt suffre tormentes in that thou sayst to me vylonnye / Saynt Agathe sayd I meruaylle moche that one so wyse a man / is suche a fole becomen / that thou sayst of them to be thy goddes / whos lyf thou ne

foule / and forsake their lyuyng / and be not of suche lyf as thy goddes were / Quyncianus said what goost thou thus vaynly spekyng / make sacrefyse / vnto the goddes / or yf thou doo not / I shal make the to deye by dyuerse tormentis / Saynt Aghate abode ferme and stable in the fayth / Theenne quyncianus dyde doo put her in a derke pryson / And she wente also gladly and with as good wyll as she had ben prayd to goon to a weddyng / On the morn quyncianus made her to be brought to fore hym in Iugement / And said to her / Agathe how art thou aduysed for thy helth / She answerd cryst is myn helthe / Quyncianus said renye cryst thy god / by whyche thou mayst escape thy tormentis / Saynt Agathe answerd / Nay / but renye y u thyn ydolles whyche ben of stones and of wood / And adoure thy maker that made heuene and erthe / And yf thou doo not / thou shalt be tormented in the perpetuell fyre in helle / Thenne in grete yre quyncianus dyde her to be drawē and stratched on a tree and tormented and sayd to her / Refuse thy vayne opnyon that thou hast / and thou shalt be eas of thy payne / •ed and she answerd I haue as grete dilection in thyse paynes / as he that sawe come to hym that thyng whyche he most coueyteth to see / or as he that had founde grete tresour / And lyke as the whete may not be put in the garner vnto the tyme / y t the chaff be beten of / in lyke wyse my-sowle may not entre in to the Royame of heuene / but yf thou wel tormente my body by thy mynystres / Thenne quyncianus dyde her to be tormentid in her brestes and pappes / and comanded that her brestis and mamellis shold be drawē & cutte of / whan y e mynystres had accomplysshid his comandement / Thenne saynt Agathe said / Ouer felon and cruelle tyraunt hast thou noo shame to cutte of that in a woman / wyche thou dydest souke in thy moder / and wherof thou were nourisshyd / But I haue my pappes hole in my soule / of whych I nourisshe all my wyttes / the whyche I haue ordeyned to serue

and whan she was fast closed in the pryson / ther cam an auncyent noble man and to fore hym a chyld beryng a lyght & dyuerse oynementis in hys hand / Thys noble mā sayd that he was a surgien / and in confortyng her sayd / how wel that the tyraunt hath tormented the bodyly / neuertheles thou hast more tormēted hym in hys herte by thy answeres / I was there whā he made thy pappes to be cutte of / And sawe how I myght well hele them / Thenne said she / I knewe neuer of medecyne corporall / And it were shame to me to take it now / That whyche I haue auowed and kept to my lord sith myn Infancye / yet I shal kepe it yf it plese hym / Thauncyent noble man answerd / I am also crystē and a good maystre and leche / be not a shamed / She answerd / wherof shold I be ashamed / thou art Auncyent & of grete age / And how wel that I be a yong mayde / Neuertheles my body is deffeted by the tormentes / that the woundes suffre nothyng to entre in to my thought wherof I shold be ashamed & not for that / I thanke the fayr fader that thou art so dylygent to hele me / but knowe that my body shal receyue no medecyne of noman / And thys noble man saide wherfore suffrest thou not me / that I maye hele and guarysshe the / She said by cause I haue Ihesu crist my sauyour whyche wyth a word heleth all / And yf he wyll he may hele me And the good man smylynge sayde / And he hath sente me hyther for to hele

thākyngis that thou hast remembryd me / and hast sente thyn appostle saynt peter to me whyche hath comforted me and heled my woundes / And after thoryson made / she sawe that her pappes were agayn restored to her / and all her woundes heled / And all that nyght was the pryson fulfyllyd wyth grete clerenes and lyght / so that the kepers fledde / for the grete drede that they had / and lefte the pryson all open / Thenne said to her the other prysoners that were in the pryson / that she shold goo theyr waye / And she sayd that shal neuer happen that the kepars of the prison shal suffre ony harme for me / ne that I shal lose my crowne / I shal abyde / in the fayth of Ihesu cryst / my lord whyche hath comforted and heled me / After foure dayes quyncianus made her to be brought to fore hym in Iugement / and sayd to her that she shold doo sacrefise to thydollis / She answerd thyse wordes ben vayn / and thy comandemētis euyl they make the ayer to stynke / he is moche meschaunt that byleueth in a stone and wythout entendement / And leueth our lord the very god that hath heled me / and hath restored to me agayn my pappes / Quincianus demanded her / who is he that hath heled the / She saide Ihesu crist Quincianus said / namest thou yet Ih̄u cryst / She answerd I shal haue in my herte Ihesu cryst as longe as I shal lyue / Quincianus said / yet shalt thou see yf he may helpe and hele the / And thenne he made her all naked to be rolled vpon brennyng brondes / And anon the grounde where the holy vyrgyne was rolled on began to tremble lyke an erthe quaue / and a parte of the walle fyl doun vpon syluayn counseyllour of quyncianus and vpon fastion hys frende / by whos counseyll she had be so tormented / And thenne all the cyte of Cathanence was abasshyd / And the peple cam rennyng vnto the hows of Quincianus sayeng in a grete bruyt / that the cyte was in a grete paryll for the tormentis that he dyde to saynte Aghate / Quincianus redoubted the bruyte of the peple / And went▪ out by hynde & comanded that she shold be remysed in pryson / whan she cam in to the pryson / she Ioyned her handes holdyng them vp to heuenward / and sayd in prayeng / ¶ Lord god Ihesu cryst whyche hast created me of nought And sith my yougth hast kept me / & hast suffred me to lyue wel in my yougth / which hast taken fro myn herte the loue of the world / and hast made me to ouercome the

thynterpretacion of hys name AMande is as moche to saye as amyalle / For he had in hym thre thynges / that make a man amyable / The first is to be courtoys and gracious in companye / As salamon sayth in his prouerbes the xix chapitre / Vir amabilis ad societatem / The second is to be honest / in conuersacion / as it is sayd of hester / hester secundo / Quod omnibus oculis amabilis videlatur / The thyrde is to be vertuons in fayth of prowesse as it is sayd in the book of paralipomenon / the second chapytre / Saul & Ionathas amabiles et decori / Of the lyf of saynt amande SAynt amand was born of noble fader and moder / On a tyme he entred in to a monastery / And as he walked and wente in the chyrch he fonde a grete serpente / whom by the vertue of hys prayer and wyth the signe of the crosse he made hym to yssue out / And to entree in to the grete pytte out of whyche he neuer yssued after / And after saynt amande cam to the sepulcre of saynt martyn / and there abode xv yere / where he lyued wyth barle brede and water / and ware alleway the hayer / After that / he wente to rome And wente in to the chyrche of saynt peter / and abode there by nyght / the kepar of the chyrche put hym out right rudely / And saynt peter appyered to hym as he laye and slepte to fore the chyrche dore / And sente hym in legacion in to fraunce / where he fonde the kyng dagobert / the whyche he repreued strongly of hys synnes / The kynge was angry and put hym out of hys Royame / After whan the kynge had no sone / he made hys prayer to god that he myght haue one / And god sente hym one / And whan he was born / he thought moche & sorowed who shold baptise hym / And it cam vnto his mynde that he wold that saynt Amande shold baptyse hym / Saynt amāde was sought and brought to the kyng / and assone as he was come the kynge fyl doun to hys feet / and prayd hym that he wold pardone hym of that he had trespaced to hym / And that he wold baptyse hys sone / And saynt amande graunted benyngly to the kyng his request / the first peticion / but not the second request / for he dredde that he wold haue desired aboute som̄e wordly occupacion or seculer thyngis / of whych he wold not gladly entremete / and wente hys waye and departed / but atte last as vaynquysshyd by the prayers of the kyng he graunted hym And thus thenne as he baptised the chyld / & noman answered / the chyld wyth a clere voys sayd and answerd Amen / And after thys the kyng prom hym to be bysshop of sence / •ted And word of god in predicacion was despised and not sette by / he wente in to Gascoygne / where he sawe a Iogeler mocqued hys wordes / The feend toke hym and with hys owen treth he tare hym / and confessid that he had don Iniurye to the persone of god and anon deyd myserably / Now it happed on a tyme that he weesshe hys handes / and a bysshop made the water to be kepte / of whych water a blynde man had hys sight agayn / It happed that in that place by the wyll of the kyng he wold edeffye a monasterye / of monkes / thenne a bysshop that was of the next cyte toke it greuously and was moche angry therwith / and comanded hys seruantes to caste hym out / or ellis they shold slee hym / And anon they came to hym and sayd to hym in gyle and treson / that he shold goo wyth them / and they wold shewe to hym a place apte and good / and water ynough / for to edyfye vpon a monastery for monkes / And he that knewe theyr malyce and theyr euyl purpoos wente with them vnto the toppe of an hye mōtayne where as they wold haue slayn hym / And he desired moche the martirdom for the loue of our lord / and for to come in to hys companye / but anon sodenly descended fro heuen suche a tempest of Rayne and of orage that it couerd alle the montayne / so moche that / that one coude not see that other / and supposed to haue deyde sodenly / And they fyl doun to therthe on their knees / praieng hym to pardonne them / And that they myght departe thens alyue / For whom he put hym self to prayer and anone the storme was appeasid and the wether fayr / They wente to theyr place / And saynt amande thus escaped fro thys perill / And many other myracles he shewde and dyde in thonour of our lord And fynysshyd in holy

lyf of saynt Uedaste SAynt Uedaste was ordeyned bysshop of arras by the hand of saynt remyge / And saynt vedast was of moche grete holynesse and clennesse For whan he cam to the yate of Arras he fonde there ij poure men of whom y e one was lame / and that other blynde Thyse two poure men demaunded of hym som̄e almesse / And saynt vedast answerd to them and said / I haue neyther gold ne siluer / but thys that I haue I gyue to you / Thenne he made them bothe hool by the vertue of hys prayer / ¶ It happed on a tyme he cā in to a chyrche destroyed / and fonde there a wulf emong the busshes / And he comāded hym that he shold goo his way / And anon he obeyed to hym & fledde / so that sith that tyme he was not seen / Atte laste whan he had conuerted moche peple by hys word and predicacion to the fayth of god / and also by good ensamples shewde euydently to the peple / in the fourtythe yere of hys bysshopryche / he sawe a douue of fyre that cam fro heuen to hys hows / And by that he vnderstode

for age was sory that he myght not see the body of saynt vedast and anon our lord enlumyned hym and rendryd to hym hys sight / And sawe the body of saynt vedaste / but anon after / he was blynde agayn as he had ben to fore / late vs praye to hym & c̄ / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Uedaste Here begynneth the lif of seynt Ualentyne and first thynterpretacion of hys name UAlentyne is as moche to saie as conteynyng valeur / that is perseueraunt in grete holynesse valentyn is sayd also as a vayliaunt knyght / For he was a right noble knyght of god / And the knyght is said valiaunt that fleeth not / and smyteth & defendeth valiantly / and ouercometh moche puyssauntly / And so saynt valentyn wythdrewe hym not fro hys martirdom in fleyng / he smote in dystroyng thydolles / he deffēded the faith he ouercam in suffryng / Of saynt Ualentyn the martre SAynt Ualentyne frende of our lord / and preest of grete auctoryte was at Rome / It happed that Claudius themperour made hym to come to fore hym / And said to hym in demandyng what thyng is that / whiche I haue herd of the valentyn / why wilt thou not abyde in our amyte / and worshyppe thydolles and renounce the vayne opynyon of thy creaunce / Sayyt valentyne answerd hym / yf thou haddest very knowleche of the grace of Ihesu cryst / thou sholdest not saye thys that thou sayest / but sholdest renye thydolles / and worshyppe veray god Thēne sayd to saynt valentyn a prynce Thenne said to saynt valentyn a prynce whiche was of the coūceylle of themperour / what wylt thou saye of our goddes and of theyr holy lyf / And saynt valentyn answerd / I saye none other thyng of them but that they were men mortall and meschaunt / and full of all ordure and euyll / Thenne sayd claudius themperour / yf Ihesu cryst be god veryly / wherfor saist not

alleway vyctorye of thyn enemyes / Thenne claudius torned hym vnto all them that were there and said to them / lordes Romayns / here ye how wysely and resonably thys man speketh / Anone the prouoste of the cyte sayd / Themperour is deceyued and bytrayed / how maye we leue that / whyche we haue holden and acostomed to holde sith our enfancie / wyth thyes wordes themperour torned and chaunged hys

neuertheles yf he may make my doughter to here and see / whyche longe tyme hath ben blynde / I shal doo all that thou comandest me / and shal byleue in thy god / Saynt valentyn anon put hym in prayers / And by hys prayers the doughter of the { pro } uoste receyued agayn her sight / And anon all they of the hows were conuerted / After thēperour dyde do smyte of the heed of saynt valentyn the yere of our lord ijClxxx / Thenne late vs praye to saynt valentyne / that he gete vs pardon / of our synnes / Amen Thus endeth the lyf of Saynt Ualentyn Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Iulian and first thynterpretacion of her name IUliane is as moche to saye as brennyng playnly / for she brente her self / ayenst the tēptaciō of the deuyll which wold haue deceyued her And she helped many other to byleue in the fayth of our lord Ihesu cryst ¶ Of saynt Iuliane SAynt Iuliane was gyuen in maryage to the prouoste of Nychomede whyche was named Elongius / And he was a paynem / And therfor she wold not assente to the maryage ne assemble wyth hym / but yf he wold first take the fayth of cryst and be baptysed / whan her fader sawe this Anone he dyde do her to be naked and made her to be beten sore / And after delyuerd her to the prouost / And after whan the prouoste helde her / and sawe the grete beaute in her / he sayd to her / my most swete Iulyane why hast thou brought me in suche cōfusion

sayd Fayr lady that may I not doo / For themperour shold thenne smyte of my heed / And she sayd / yf thou doubtest so moche themperour whyche is mortal / why shold not I doubte myn emperour Ilesu cryst whyche is inmortal doo what thou wylt / For thou maist not deceyue me / Thēne the prouoste dyde her to be bete / most cruelly wyth Roddes / And half adaye to hange by the heeris of her heed / and molten leed to be caste on her heed And whan he sawe that all thys greued her not / he made her to be bounden in chaynes / and to be sette in pryson / To whome the deuylle cam thenne in the lyknes of an Angele / which said to her in thys manere / Iulyane I am the angele of god whyche hath sente me to the to warne and saye that thou make sacrefise to thydolles for teskape the tormentis of euyl

a voys that sayd / that she shold sette honde on hym / and that she constrayne hym to confesse what he was / ¶ And anon she toke hym / and demanded hym / And he said that he was the deuyll / ¶ And that hys fader had sente hym theder for to deceyue her / She demaunded hym who is thy fader / ¶ And he answerd beelzebub / whyche sendeth vs for to doo all euyll / And maketh vs greuously to be beten

euyl cogytacions & thoughtes / and wylle make hys prayers and do hys good werkis / and here the wordes of god and the dyuyne seruyse / Of hym we be cast out / And whan they receyue the body of Ihesu

Iulian shold be brought to fore hym in Iugement And whan he sawe her so wel guarisshed and her vysage so fayr / and so shynyng / thenne said the prouoste to her Iulyane who hath taught the and how mayst thou vaynquyssh the tormentis / And she sayd herkene to me / and I shal saye to the My lord Ihesu cryst hath taught me to adoure the fader the sone and the holy ghoost / For I haue ouercomen and vaynquysshyd Sathanas thy fader / and alle hys other deuyllis / For god hath sente hys Angell for to conforte me and to helpe me / Meschaunt man knowest thou not / that the tormentis ben made redy fore the euerlastyng / where thou shal be tormentid perpetuelly in a perpetuel derkenes and obscurete / Anon the prouoste made to be brought a whele of yron bytwene two pylers and iiij horses to draw it forth And foure knyghtes at one side and foure knyghtes on that other to drawe and foure for to drawe forth the whele so that alle the body was tobroken / in suche wyse that the mary cam out of the bones / And the wheel was al blody / Thenne cam an angel of god and brake the wheel / and heled the wondes of saynt Iulyane and heled perfaytly / And for thys myracle were conuertid alle they that were present / And anon after for the fayth of Ihesu cryst / were byheded men and wymen to the nomof Cxxx personnes / After comanded the prouost / that she shold be put in a grete potte ful of

/ and of her haue no mercy / For she hath blamed your goddes / And don moche harme / ¶ And me she hath beten thys nyght passed / Therfore rendre to her that she hath deseruyd / Wyth thyes wordes saynt Iuliane loked behynde her for to wyte who sayd suche wordes of her / ¶ Anone the deuyl sayd / Alas / Alas Caytyf that I am I doubte me / that yet she wylle take and bynde me / ¶ And so he vanysshyd away / After thys that she had admonested the peple to loue and serue Ihesu cryst / she prayd them alle to praye for her / And thenne her heed was smeton of / The prouoste entred in to a shyppe wyth xxxiiij men for to passe an Arme of the see / Anon cam a grete orage and a tempest / which drowned the prouost and alle hys cōpanye in the see / ¶ And the see threwe theyr bodyes to the Ryuage / And wylde beestes cam thyder and ete them / Thus thys holy vygyne saynt Iulane suffryd martirdom for our lord the xiiij kalendes of the moneth of marche / late vs praye to her that she praye for vs & c̄ / Thus endeth the lyf and passion of saynt Iulian virgyne Of thee chayeryng of saynt Peter thappostle THe chayer is sayd in thre maners / that is the chayer Ryall as it is said in the boke of kynges / Dauid sittyng in a chayer / And ther is a chayer of prestes as regum prymo / Hely the preeste syttyng vpon a chayer / And the thyrde is the chayer for a Mayster / as is sayd / Mathei xxiij / vpon the chayer of moyses et cetera / Thenne saynt peter satte in a chayer ryall / For he was prynce of thappostles And he satte in the chayer of prestes / For he was lord of alle the prestes / And in the chayer of the maystre / For he was a grete doctour of crysten men / The first was of equyte / The seconde of quātyte / And the thirde of trouthe and of vertue / HOly chyrche haloweth the feste of saynt petre thappostle / & this day was seynt petre honourably enhaūced in y e cite of anthioche / & sette in the chaier as a bysshop / Many causes ther ben / wherfore thys feste is halowed and establysshyd / Of whom the first is as is sayd in a sermon of thys feste / that whan saynt peter wente for to preche the word of god / and founded holy chyrche by hys predycacion / Niceta & Aquila shewed vnto the cyte of Anthioche / that peter thappostle of god cam theder / wherfore the peple / And also the nobles of the cyte / cam ayenst hym And knowleched them self culpable / of that they had holden of the predicacion of Symon magus / whyche was an enchaunteur / ¶ After they dyde to be brought to fore hym all suche people as were vexid wyth dyuerse maladyes and sekenesses / of whom there were so many that they myght not be nombred / ¶ Saynt peter behelde theyr repentaunce / ¶ And also that they byleuyd fermly in the name of god / And anon lyft vp hys handes vnto heuen and made hys prayr to god sayeng / ¶ O god fader almyghty I yelde to the thankynges / in thys that thou hast worthyly fulfyllyd the promesses of thy blessyd sone by whyche alle creatures may knowe that thou art one onely god in heuen and in erthe / And after he ascended vp in to an hye place / And alle the multytude of sekemen were brought to fore hym / And said to them in thys manere / ye that see me a mortal man as ye be / wene ne suppose not ye / that by me ye may be heled / but by hym that is descended fro heuene to therthe / whyche gyueth to alle them that byleue in hym full helthe of body and of soule / thys ought ye to byleue / to thende that alle may knowe that ye y t thus byleue entierly wyth all your herte in Ihesu cryst may and guarisshid by hym / & anone all they y t were seke cried with an hie vois / we byleue that Ih̄u crist is veray god / sodenly a light appierid there / And alle the seke peple were guarysshed and beled / of what someuer maladye they had / And that same day the holy ghoost shewde so gretely hys grace / that fro the leste vnto the moste / Alle byleued in our lord Ihesu cryst / ¶ And there were baptised in vij dayes more than ten thousand persones of men wymen and chyldren / ¶ And also theophilus the lord and prouost of the cyte / to whom seynt peter had reysed his sone / whyche had ben xiiij yere deed / And som̄e saye that of hys palays he made a chyrche / in the whyche alle the peple sette vp a chayer for saynt peter to sytte in more hyer for to preche the doctryne of Ihesu cryste / and the better to be herd and seen / And of thexaltyng thus of saynt peter in to thys chayer / thys feste taketh the name of the chayeryng of saynt peter / And in thys chyrche was saynt peter vij yere And fro thens he wente to Rome / and gouerned the chirche of Rome xxv yere / ¶ That other reason why thys feste was establysshed was for the reuerence of the crowne or tonsure on hys heed / whyche yet clerkes bere and haue / ¶ For lyke as som̄e saye / at this Iourneye was first founde the crowne of the clerkes / For whan saynt peter prechyd atte fyrst tyme in the cyte of anthioche / the paynems share hym vpon hys heed aboue lyke a fool in despysyng crysten lawe / And by cause thys was don to saynt Peter / For to doo hym despyte and shame / it was syth / stablysshyd that the clergye shold haue hys crowne shauen / in signe of right grete honour and auctoryte / And it is to wete that in the crowne ben thre thyngis / Fyrst the heed is dyscouerd and bare aboue / and the heer cut away / And the crowne is rounde / Ther ben thre resons why the heed is bare / of whyche saynt denys assygneth the tweyne / and sayth the rasure and cuttyng of / of the heer signefyeth pure lyf and clene wythout ony arayeng wythout forth / For lyke as heeris ben naturelly for to aourne the heed / right so dysforme they the heed whan they be cut of by mocquery or other wyse / Also good maners whych ought to aourne the clene lyf / defforme the holy conuersacion whan they ben left & takē away by habites couoytous and proude / Also the rasure or shauyng whyche is on the ouermest parte of the heed / signefieth that bytwene god & them / ought be nethyng ne mene that shold dysplese god / but their loue shold be in god wythout ony lettyng & enpesshement / And shold adresse in hem theyr thoughtes / The second thyng that is in the crowne is that the heeris bey shaue clene away / by that is signefied that the clerkes ought to take away fro their hertes all vayne thoughtes / whiche myght lette & enpesshe the seruyse dyuyne / & also ought to be with drawen frō all tēporall besynesse / sauf only to haue their necessitees / The third thyng that is in the crowne / is that it is r good by many resons / The first it that a roūde figure hath neyther begynnyng ne ende / The second is in a round crowne bē no corners / And as saynt bernard saith where as ben corners / there is gladly filth / and that is to be vnderstonde / that the clerkes ought not to haue in their hertes no corners where y e filthe of synnes myght assemble / but ought to haue a clene conscience / And also they ought to haue trouthe in their mouthes For as sayth saynt Iherome / trouthe seketh no corners / The thirde reason is For lyke as the figure of a crowne / is most fayre emong all other / So the conuersacion of clerkes or prestes ought to be best aourned of good maners emong all other laye peple / The fourth reson is / for lyke as a crowne hath but one way rounde and no fygure / lyke as saynt Austyn sayth / ther is none so symple a fygure as that whyche hath but one way / Also the clerkes ought to be symple in theyr conuersacion wyth out fiction / and pryde / And it is to wite that holy chyrche haloweth of saynt peter iij festes in the yere for thre yeftes / that he hath power to gyue to the peple / The first is the chayer For he gyueth absolucion of synnes / The second feste is called aduincula / that is the first day of August / Fur he by hys power transumeth the payne perpetuell due for synnes mortall in to payne temporell / The thyrde feste is of hys martyrdom / For he hath power to relece sōme paynes of penaunce enioyned for the synnes confessyd / And for thyse thre causes / he is dygne and worthy honourably to be serued and worshypped / Late vs thenne praye to hym / that he may Impetre and gete to vs remyssyon of alle our synnes / and after thys short transitorye lyf we may come to euerlastyng Ioye and glorye in heuen / 〈◊〉 made hool •unde / and this figure semeth Amen Thus endeth the Chayeryng of saynt Peter Of saynt Mathye thappostle / & fyrst thynterpretacion of hys name MAthias in hebrewe is as moch to saie as gyuen to our lord / or a gift of our lord / or ellis hūble or lityl / For he was gyuen of our lord / whan he was chosen fro the world / and was sette and entred emong the lxxij dyscyples / he was also gyuen of our lord / whan he was chosen by lotte & nombred emong thappostles / he was lityl / For he had all veray mekenes / in hym & humylite ¶ Ther be iij maners of humylitees as saynt Ambrose saith that the first is of the affliction by whyche aman is made humble / The second is consideraciō of of hym self / & the third is of y t deuocion which is of the knowleche of his maker / Saynt mathye had the first in suffryng martirdom / The second was in despysyng hym self / and he had the third in amerueyllyng the mageste of our lord / For mathye is said / as doyng good for euyl / For he beyng good was sette in the place of Iudas the traytre / And hys lyf is redde in holy chyrche and bede wryteth it as many holy men wytnesse / ¶Of saynt mathye SAynt mathye thappostle was in the place of Iudas the traytre / And therfore first we shal reherce here the birthe and begynnyng of Iudas It is redde in an hystorye thaugh it it be named apocripha that ther was a man in Iherusalem named r and by another name Symeon of the kynred of dauid / or after saynt Iherome of the trybe of ysachar whyche had a wyf named Ciborea / and on the nyght that Iudas was conceyued hys moder had a merueyllous dreme wherof she was so sore aferd / For her semed that she had conceyued a chyld that shold destroye their peple / and by cause of the losse of alle theyr peple / her husbond blamed her moche and sayd to her thou sayst a thyng ouer euylle / or the deuylles wyl deceyue the / She sayd certaynly yf so be that I shal haue a sone / I trowe it shal be so as I haue had a reuelacion and none illusion / whan the chyld was born the fader and moder were in grete doubte / and thoughte what was beste to doo / ¶ For they durst not slee the chyld For thorrour that they shold haue therin / neyther they wyst not how they myght nourysshe one that shold destroye theyr lygnage / Thenne they put hym to a lytyl fyscelle or baskette wel pytched & sette it the in see And abandonned hym to dryue whyther it wold / ¶ And anon the floodes and wal and made hym aryue in an ylonde named Scaryoth / ¶ And of thys name was he callyd Iudas Scaryoth / Now it happed that the quene of this contree wente for to playe on the ryuage of the see / And byheld thys lytyl nacelle and the chyld / therin whyche was fayr / And thenne she syghed and sayd / ¶ O lord god how shold I be eased yf I had suche a chyld / Thenne atte leste shold not my Royame be wythoute heyre / Thenne comanded she that the chyld shold be taken vp and be nourysshid and she fayned her self to be grete with chyld / And after publysshyd that she had born a fayr sone / whan her husbond herd saye herof / he had grete Ioye / and all the peple of the contre made grete feste / ¶ The kynge and quene dyde do norysshe and kepe thys chylde lyke the sone of a kynge / Anon after it happed that the quene conceyued a sone / And whan it was born and growen Iudas bete ofte that chylde / For he wende that he had ben hys broder and ofte he was chastysed therfore / but allewaye he made hym to wepe so longe that the quene / whyche knew wel that Iudas was not her sone / And atte laste she sayd the trouthe / and tolde how that Iudas was founden in the see / and yet this er was knowen Iudas slewe the chylde that he had supposed to be hys brother and was sone to the kynge / And in eschewyng the sentence of deth / he fledde anon and cam in to Iherusalem / And entred in to the court of pylate whyche tho was prouoste / And he so plesid hym that he was grete with hym and had in grete chyerete / and nothyng was doon wythout hym / Now it happed on a day that pylate wente for to dysporte hym by a gardyn / bylongyng to the fader of Iudas / And was so desirous to ete of the fruyt of thapp And the fader of Iudas knewe not Iudas hys sone / For he had supposed that he had be drowned in the see longe to fore ne the sone knewe not the fader / whan pylate had told to Iudas of hys desyre he sprange in to the gardyn of hys fader / and gadred of the fruyt for to bere And ther bygan bytwene them moche stryf and debate fyrst by wordes / and after wyth fyghtyng so moche that Iudas smote hys fader wyth a stone on the heed / that he slewe hym / ¶ And after brought thapples vnto pylate / And tolde to hym how that he had slayn hym that ought the gardyn / Thenne sente pylate to sease all the good that the fader of Iudas had / And after gaf hys wyf to Iudas in mariage / And thus Iudas wedded hys owen moder / Now it happed on a day that the lady wepte & sighed moche strongly & said / alas how vnhappy that I am / I haue lost my sone & my husbond / My sone was leyd on the see and I suppose that he be drowned and my husbond is dede sodeynly / And yet it is more greuous to me that pylate hath remaryed me ayenst my wyll Thenne demaūded Iudas of thys child And she told hym how he was sette in the see / And Iudas tolde to her how he had be foūden in the see / in suche wise y t she wist that she was his moder / & that he had slayn hys fader / & wedded hys moder / wherfor thēne he wente to Ihesu cryst which dyde so many myracles / & prayd hym of mercy & forgifnes of his synnes / Thus fer it is red in thistorye which is not autentike / Our lord made Iudas one of his appostles & reteyned hym in his cōpanye / and was so pryue with hym / that he was made his procuratour & bare the purse for all the other / and stale of that whiche was gyuen to cryst / Thenne it happed that he was sory and angry / for thoygne mēt that Marye magdalene poured on the heed and feet of our lord Ihesu crist & sayd that it was worth CCC pens and sayd that so moche he had lost / And therfor sold he Ihesu cryst for xxx pens of y e money vsual / of whiche euery peny was worth x pens / And so he recouuerd CCC pens / Or after that som̄e saye / that he ought to haue of all the yeftes that was gyuen to Ihesu cryst the tenthe peny / And so he recouerd xxx pens of that he sold hym And neuerthheles atte leste he brought them agayn to the temple and after henge hym self in despayr / And hys body opened and clefte a sonder / and hys bowellis fylle out / And so it apperteyned wel that it shold so be / for y e mouth whyche god had kyssyd ought not to be defouled in touchyng / & also he ought not to dye on the erthe / by cause all erthely creatures ought to hate hym / but in the ayer where deuyllys and wyckyd spyrites had deseruyd to be in theyr companye / Thenne whan the tyme cam bytwene thascencion / and wythsontyde saynt peter byheld that the nombre of thappostles was menusshyd / he aroos vp in the myddle of the dyscyples / and said fair brethern / ye knowe how our lord Ihesu cryst hadde chosen xij men for to bere wytnesse of hys resurrection / And Iudas was goon the euyl waye / It behoueth taccomplysshe the nombre of xij / of suche as hath ben wyth hym / And sith they chosen two of them that were there / that one was named Ioseph surnamed Iustus / and that other was mathye / And thenne they made their orysons & said / lord god whyche knowest the hertes of all the persones / Shewe to vs whome we shal chese of thyes tweyne here / And after they caste lottes / and the lotte fylle on mathye / whyche forth wyth was enombred wyth the other xj / And thenne were they xij / But the holy saynt denys sayth that the lotte was a Raye and a shynyng whyche cam and shone vpon hym / And anon he bygan to preche / and had hys predycacion aboute Iherusalem / And was moche vertuous and dyde many myracles as is wreton of hym of whom the legende foloweth / whyche legende is founde at Tryre in Almayne / •ben / •es of the see brought •lles that he myght not forbere them / •o hys maystre / but the fader of Iudas deffended hym / •ee / by cause he SAynt mathye whyche was sette in the place of Iudas / was born in bethleem of the trybe of Iuda / he was sette to scole and in a lytyl tyme he lerned all the science of the lawe and of the prophetes / he was a ferd of flesshly lustes / And he passyd hys yongthe in good maners / hys corage was enclyned to all vertues / ¶ For he was humble and debonayr / and allewaye redy vnto do mercy / And was not proud in prosperite / ne fraylle in aduersytee / he dyde that / whyche he prechid he made the blynde to see and heled the seke men / he reysed the dede men / and dide grete myracles in the name of Ihesu cryste / And whan he was accused herof to fore the bysshop of Iherusalem / it was demaunded hym that he shold answere therto / And he sayd / It behoueth not moche tanswere herto / by cause for to be a crysten man it is nothyng crymynel / but it is a gloryous lyf Thenne sayd the bysshop that he wold spare hym and gyue hym respyte to repente hym / And saynt Mathye answerd god forbede that I shold repente of the trouthe that I haue truly founden and become an apostate / He was ferme in the loue of god & clene of hys body / and wyse in spekyng to alle the questions of scripture / And whan he prechyd the word of god / many byleuyd in Ihesu cryst by hys predicacion / The Iewes toke hym And brougt hym to Iustyce / and had goten two false wytnesses ayenst hym and for taccuse hym / the whyche caste on hym fyrst stones / and the other after / and so was stoned / And he prayd that the stones myght be buryed that the false wytnessys had cast vpon hym / For to bere wytnesse agayn thē that stoned hym / And fynably he was slayn wyth an axe after the maner of the Romayns / And he held vp hys handes / and comaunded hys esperyte to god / And after is is sayd that hys body was brought to Rome / And fro rome it was translated vnto t and buryed vnder a stone of pourphyrye in the chyrche of saynt marye the maior / •yre Another legende sayth that hys hody lyeth at Rome / ¶Of saynt Gregorye the pope GRegorye is sayd of grex whyche is to saye a flock / & of gere whych is to saye a prechour / Thenne Gregorye is to saye as a prechour / to an assemble or flock of peple / or it is said as a noble doctour / or prechour / Or gregorye is to saye in our langage as awaked / For the awoke to hym self to god / and to the peple / he awoke to hym self by kepyng of clennesse / to god by good contemplacion / And to the peple by contynuel predycacion / And by thys is deserued the vision of god / And saynt Austyn sayth in the book of ordre / that he seeth god / that wel lyueth / wel studyeth and wel prayeth / And poul thystoryograph of the lombardes wryteth his hystorye and lyf of hym / the whyche Ioh̄n the dekene afterward moche dylygently compyled and ordeyned / SAynt Gregorye was born of the parentele of senatoures of Rome whos fader was named Gordyane / and hys moder siluia / And whan he had so moche lerned that he was a maystre / in phylosophye and also was ryche of patrymonye / he thoughte that he wold leue all the rychesses that he had and wold entre in to religyon for to serue god / but in thys that he put thys thought in respyte / he conseyued another purpoos / that was that hym semed he shold better serue god in a seculer habyte / in dooyng thoffyce of the pretorye of the prouost of R god / In thys mene whyle hys fader and moder deyden / in suche wyse that he was ryche of patrymonye and puyssaunt / that atte begynnyng he founded and endowed wyth rentes vj abbeyes in zecylle / And the seuenth he founded wythin the walles of Rome / in thonour of saynt Andrew thappostle / in the whyche he becam a monke / And the remanaunt of his patrymonye he gaf for goddes sake / So that he that to fore wente clothed in clothes of gold and of silke / and aourned wyth precious stones in the cyte / whan he was monke seruyd in a poure habyte the monkes / There was atte begynnyng of hys conuersacion / of so parfayt a lyf / that it myght be sayd wel that he was all parfayt / he made grete abstynences in etyng / in drynkyng / in wakyng / and in prayeng in so moche / that he was so trauaylled that vnnethe he myght susteyne hym self / he had put out of hys herte alle seculier thynges / so that hys conuersacion was in heuen / For he had adressid alle hys desyre for to come to the Ioye permanable / On a tyme it happed that saynt gregorye in hys selle of the same abbaye / where as he was abbote wrote somme thyng / And an Angele appered to hym in semblaunce of a maronner whyche semed as he had escaped fro the tempest of the see / And prayd hym wepyng to haue pyte on hym Thenne saynt gregorye comanded that ther shold be gyuen to hym vj pens / And thenne he departed / The same day the angele cam agyan in lyke wyse as he dyde to fore / And sayd that he had lost all hys good and prayd hym that he wold yet helpe hym / on whō saynt gregorye had yet pyte / and dyde do be gyuen to hym vj pens more / yet atte thyrde tyme he cam and made grete crye and wepte / and prayd hym that he wold yet helpe hym to ward hys grete losse / so that saynt gregorye comanded hys prouoste that he shold yet gyue to thys poure man an almesse / And the prouoste sayd / that ther was nomore siluer in all thabbaye but a disshe of siluer in whyche hys moder was wonte to sende hym potage / And saynt gregorye comanded anon that / that dysshe of siluer shold be gyuen to hym / And the angele toke it wyth grete Ioye / And lytyl whyle after thys angele appyeryd to saynt gregorye and sayd to hym that god hath sente hym so to hym / It happed afterward that as saynt gregory passed thurgh the market of Rome / and sawe there two fair chyldren whyt and rody of vysage / & fayr yelow heer / whiche were for to selle And saynt gregory demaunded fro whens they were / And the marchaūt answerd of englond / After saynt gregory demaunded yf they were crysten and he answerd nay / but that they were paynems / Thenne sight saynt gregorye and sayd Alas / what fayr peple hath the deuyl in hys doctryne and in hys domynacion / After he demaunded how thyse peple were called / he answerd that they were called englyssh men / thenne he said they may well be so called / for they haue the vysage of angelles / And for that saynt gregory wente to the pope / And by grete prayers he Impetred and had graūte that he was sente in to englond for to conuerte the peple of the same contre / but whā the Romayns herd saye that gregorye was sent in to englond / Anon they wente to the pope and sayd to hym / Thou hast angred saynt peter / thou hast destroyed al Rome / And hurte all holy chyrche / in this that thou hast lete gregorye goon out of Rome / Of whyche word the pope was angry and moche abasshed / And sente anone his messagers after saynt gregory / And comanded hym to retorne / and come agayn to Rome / whyche thenne was goon on hys Iourney / thre dayes / and for hys noble and good renomee the pope made hym cardynal deken / After for the corrupcion of thayer the pope pelagius deyed / And thenne saynt gregorye was electe / of alle the paple to be pope / but he refused it and sayd / that to that dygnyte he was not worthy / And for the ryght grete mortalyte er that he was sacred pope he made to the peple a sermon and said / Ryght dere brethern wel ought we to haue doubte of the scorge of god er that we fele it / And yet we ought to fere it & to torne and forsake our synnes / loo ye may beholde the peple deye er they bywepe theyr synnes / Thynk ye thenne in what poynt he cometh in the presence of the Iuge / that hath had no tyme to bewaylle hys synnes / The howses ben voyde / the chyldren deye in the presence of fader and moder sodaynly so that they haue lytyl tyme to deye / wher fore euery man amende hys lyf / whylis he hath tyme for to repente hym of hys euyl dedes and synnes / er that the Iuge calle hym / fro the mortal body / he sayth by the prophete / I wylle not the deth of a synnar / but I wyl that he retorne and lyue / moche soone the Iuge hereth the synnar whan he conuerteth fro hys synnes and amendeth hys lyf / By suche manere admonested he to the peple theyr helthe / And he or deyned to make processyon in alle the chyrches moche solempnly for to impetre and gete mercy for thys mortalyte / whan the processyon was doon / he wold haue goon pryuely out of Rome for thescewe thoffyce of the papalyte / but ayenst that / the gates were kepte so that he myght not yssue / Atte laste he dyde do chaunge hys habyte / And so moche dyde wyth the marchaunts / that they brought hym out of Rome in a tonne vpon a carte / And whan he was ferre out of the toun / he yssued out of the tonne / and hydde hym in a dyche / And whan he had ben therin iij dayes the peple of Rome sought hym all aboute / Anone they sawe a pyler shynyng descende fro heuen strayt vpon the dyche / in whyche saynt gregorye was / And a recluse an holy man sawe that by that pyler angellis descended fro heuen to saynt gregory / and after wente vp agayn / Anone thenne saynt gregory was taken of the peple / and after thordynaunce of holy chyrche he was ordeyned and sacred pope ayenst hys wyll / For he was moche debonayr / humble and mercyful to riche and poure and to grete and smale / wel may he apperceyue / that redeth his wrytynges / how ofte he complayned of thys grete charge that he was charged wyth alle / to whyche he sayd he was not worthy therto / and also he myght not here that ony shold preyse hym ne in lettres ne in wordes / And alleway he was in grete humylite / and acounted hym self more meke and lowe after that he was pope than to fore in so moche that he was the first of the popes that wrote seruus seruorum dei / that is seruaūt of the seruantis of god he had grete cure and was besy to conuerte synnars / he made and compyled many fayr bookes / of whyche the chirche is gretly enlumyned / he was neuer ydle / how wel that he was alleway seke / he conuerteth the englisshe peple to the crysten fayth by thre holy men and good clerkys that he sente thyder / that is to wyte Augustyn / mellitus / and Ioh̄n / for to preche the fayth / And by cause the mortalyte cessyd not he ordeyned a procession / in the whyche he dyde do bere an ymage of our lady / which as is sayd saynt luke the euangelyste made / whyche was a good payntour / he had coruen it & paynted after the lykenesse of the gloryouse virgyne marye And anon the mortalyte cessed / and thayer becam pure and clere / And aboute thymage was herd a voys of angellis that songen thys Antheme regina celi letare & c̄ / And saynt gregory put therto / Ora pro nobis deum alleluya / At the same tyme saynt gregory sawe an angele vpon a Castelle / whyche made clene a swerd alle blody and put it in to the shethe / And therby saynt gregory vnderstode that the pestylence of thys mortalite was passed / and after that / it was called the castell Angell / Saynt gregory dyde euery day so grete almesse / that many in the contre aboute were nourisshid by hym / whom he had by name wreton / And also the monkes that dwellyd in the mount Synay had of hym theyr sustenaunce / Emonge alle other almesses that he dyde / he gouerned thre thousand virgyns / to whom he sente euery yere four score pound of gold / and also he founded to them an abbeye in Iherusalem / ¶ And sente to them that therin were suche thynge as they lacked / Euery day had he poure men to dyner / On a tyme it happed that he toke the lauour for to gyue water to a pylgrym for to wasshe hys hondes by grete humylite / and anon the pylgrym vanysshyd a way / wherof saynt gregory had merueylle / The nyght after our lord appiered in a vysion and said to hym / The other dayes thou hast receyued me in my membres / but yesterday thou receyuedest me in my persone / Another day saynt gregory comaunded to hys dyspenser that he shold brynge to dyner xij poure men / And whan saynt gregory and the poure men were sette atte mete / he tolde atte table syttyng xiij poure pylgryms / And demaunded of hys dyspenser why he had don aboue hys comandement / to brynge in moo than xij persones / And anon the dyspenser all abasshyd wente and told the poure men and fonde but xij / and sayd to saynt gregory / holy fader ther be no moo but xij / and so many shal ye fynd and nomoo / Thenne considerid saynt gregorye that one of the pylgryms that sette next to hym ofte chaunged hys vysage / For ofte he semed yong / and after old / And after dyner saynt gregory toke hym by the honde and brought hym in to hys chambre / and prayd hym that he wold telle hym hys name / And he answerd wherfor demādest thou my name which is merueyllous / neuertheles knowe thou wel that I am the same poure maronner / to whom thou gauest the dyssh of siluer in which thy moder was wonte to sente the potage / And knowe for certayn that sith that day / that thou dydyst to me that almesse / god hath destyned the / to be pope / And sayd more ouer / I am thangelle of god / and he hath sente me hyther to the to be thy deffendour / & procurour / of that whiche thou woldest demande and Impetre of hym / And after this the angele vanysshed away / And in that tyme ther was an heremyte an holy man whyche had lefte and forsaken all the goodes of the world for goddes sake / and had reteyned nothyng but a catte / wyth whyche he playde ofte / and helde it in hys lappe delyciously / On a day it happed that he prayd god deuoutly that he wold wouch had left all the world and renounced / vpon thys god shewd hym in a vysion that saynt gregory and he shold haue lyke Ioye in heuene / And whan he vnder stode thys he syghed sore / and preysid lytyl hys pouerte whyche he had longe suffred and born / yf he shold haue lyke meryte whyche habounded so gretly in seculer Rychesse / vpon this ther cam a voys to hym whyche said / that the possession of richesse maketh not a man in this world riche / but the ardour of couetyse / Thenne be stille thou / darest thou compare thy pouerte to the rychesse of saynt gregory / whyche louest more thy catte with whom thou cessest not to stroke and playe / than saynt gregory doth all his richesses / for he seesseth neuer to gyue almesse for goddes sake / Thenne theremyte thanked almyghty god and prayd that he myght haue hys meryte and reward with saynt gregory in the glorye of peradys / On a day it happed that saynt gregory sange masse in the chyrche of saynt Marye Maior / And whan he had said / Pax dominj sit semper vobiscum / Anone thangele sayd / Et cum spiritu tuo / and fro than forthon the pope ordeyned a stacion in that chyrche euery yere on ester day / And whan thenne he sayd in hys masse / Pax dominj & c̄ / none shal answere in remembraunce of this myracle / In the tyme that Traian themperour regned / & one as a tyme he wēte toward abatayll out of Rome / it happed that in his way as he shold ryde a woman a wydowe cam to hym wepyng and sayd / I pray the sire that thou auēge the deth of one my sone / whiche Innocently and wythout cause hath be slayn / Themperour answerd / yf I come agayn fro the bataylle hool and sounde / thenne I shal doo Iustyce for the deth of thy sone / Thenne said the wydowe / Syre / and yf thou deye in the bataylle / who shal thenne auenge his deth / And themperour sayde / he that shal come after me / And the wydowe sayd / is it not better that thou do to me Iustyce / and haue the meryte therof of god / than another haue it for the / Thenne had traian pyte / and descended fro hys hors / and dyde Iustice in auengyng the deth of her sone / On a tyme saynt gregory wente by the market of Rome / whyche is called the market of traian / And thene he remembred of the Iustice and other good dedes of traian / and how he had ben pyteous and debonayr / and was moche sorowful that he had ben a paynem / And he torned to the chyrche of saynt peter wayllyng for thorrour of the mescreaunce of traian / Thenne answerd a voys fro god / sayeng I haue now herd thy prayer / and haue spared traian fro the payne perpetuell / By thys thus as som̄e saye / the payne perpetuel due to traian as a mescreaunt was somdele take away / but for al that was not he quyte fro the pryson of helle / For the sowle may wel be in helle / and fele ther no payne by the mercy of god / And after it is sayd that the angele in hys answere sayd more to thus / by cause thou hast prayd for a payneme / god graunteth the to chese of ij thynges that one which thou wylt / Or thou shalt be ij dayes in purgatorye in payne / or ellis all the dayes of thy lyf thou shalt languysshe in sekenesse / Thenne answerd saynt gregory / that he had leuer to haue sekenesse all his lyf in this world / than to fele by ij dayes the paynes of purgatorye / And euer after he had contynuelly the feures or axces / or the goute in hys feet / And herof hym self maketh mencion in one hys epystle and sayth / I am so moche tormented of the gowte in my feet and of other sekenesses / that my lif is to me a grete payne euery day me semeth that I ought to deye / And alleway I abyde the deth / Som̄e tyme my payne is lityl / & somtyme right grete / but it is not so lityl / that it departeth fro me / ne so grete y t it bryngeth me to deth / And thus it is that I that am alleway redy to deye / am withdrawen fro deth / It happed that a wydowe that was wonte euery sonday to brynge hoostes to synge masse wyth / shold on a tyme be houselyd & cōmuned / And whan saynt gregory shold gyue to her the holy sacrament / in sayeng / Corpus dominj nostrj & c̄ / that is to saye / the body of our lord Ih̄u cryst / kepe the in to euerlastyng lyf / Anone thys woman began to smyle to fore saynt gregorye / And anon he wythdrewe hys honde / and remysed the sacrament vpon thaulter / And he demaunded her to fore the peple why she smyled / And she sayd by cause y t the brede that I haue made with my propre handes / thou namest it the body of our lord Ihesu cryst / Anone saynt gregory put hym self to prayer wyth the peple / For to praye to god that herupō he wold shewe hys grace for to conferme our byleue / And whan they were rysen fro prayer / saynt gregorye sawe the holy sacrament in figure of a pyece of fhessh as grete as the lytil fynger of an honde / And anone after by the prayers of saynt gregorye / the flesshe of the sacrament torned in to semblaūce of breed / as it had be to fore / And therwyth he comuned and howseled the woman / whiche after was more relygyous and the peple more ferme in the fayth / Saynt gregorye made and ordeyned the songe of thoffyce of holy chirche / and establysshed at Rome two scoles of songe / that one beside the chyrche of saynt peter / And that other by the chyrche of saynt Ioh̄n latian / where the place is yet where he laye and taughte the scoliers / and the rodde wyth whiche he menaced them / And the anthyphoner / on whyche he lerned them is yet there / he put to the canon of the masse thse wordes / Dies { que } nostros in tua pace disponamus / at { que } ab eterna dampnacione nos eripias / et in electorum tuorum iubeas grege numerari / Atte laste whan saynt gregory had ben pope xiij yere / vj monethis / and x dayes / he beyng ful of good werkes departed out of thys world in the yere of our lord vjCvj yere in the tyme whan foca was Emperour of rome / Lete vs thēne praye to saynt gregory / that he gete vs grace that we may amende so our self here in thys lif that we may come vnto euerlastyng lyf in heuen / Amen •me / ¶ For to gyue to eche man duely reson after the right of hys cause / but he fonde in this office so grete seculer besynesse / that it began to dysplese hym / by cause by thys grete besynesse / he wythdrewe hym ouer for fro • • sauf to shewe to hym to what saynt he shold be in lyke Ioye in heuen / by cause for his loue he Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Gregorye Here begynneth of saynt longius the lyf LOngius whyche was a puyssaūt knyght was wyth other knyghtes by the comandement of pylate on the side of the crosse of our lord and percyd the side of our lord wyth a spere / And whan he sawe the myracles / how the sonne lost his light / and grete erthequauyng of therthe was / whan our lord suffred deth and passion in the tre of the crosse / Thenne byleued he in Ihesu cryst / Som̄e saye that whan he smote our lord wyth the spere in the syde / the precious blood aualed by the shafte of the spere vpon hys hondes / And of auenture wyth hys hondes he touched hys eyen / And anon he that had be to fore blynde sawe anon clerly / wherfor he refused all cheualrye / and abode wyth thappostles / of whom he was taught and crystened and after he abandonned to lede an holy lyf / in doyng almesses and in kepyng the lyf of a mōke / aboute xxxviij yere in cesaree and in Capadoce / And by hys wordes and hys example / many men conuerted he to the fayth of cryste / And whan thys cam to the knowleche of octouian the prouoste / he toke hym and wold haue constrayned hym to do sacrefise to thydollis / And saynt longius said / Ther may noman serue two lordes whyche ben contrary to other / Thyn ydollis ben lordes of thy malices / corruptours of all good werkis and enemyes to chastyte / humylite and to bounte / And frendes to all ordure of luxurye / of gloutonnye / of ydelnesse / of pryde / and of Auaryce / And my lord is lord of sobrenesse that bryngeth the peple to the euerlastyng lyf / Thenne sayd the prouoste / it is nought y t thou saist / Make sacrefice to thydollis And thy god shal forgyue the by cause of the comandement that is made to the / longius said yf thou wylt becomē cristen / god shal pardonne the thy trespaces / Thenne the prouost was angry and made the teeth of saynt longius to be drawen out of hys mouth / and dyde do cutte hys mouth open / And yet for alle that longius lost not hys speche / but toke an axe that he there fonde & hewe and brake therwith thydollis and said / now may we see yf they be very goddes or not / And anon the deuyllis yssued out and entred in to the body of the prouoste / amd hys felaws / And they brayed lyke beestes / and fyll doun to the feet of saynt longius / and sayd we knowe wel that thou art seruaunt vnto the souerayn god / And saynt longius demaunded of the deuylles why they dwellyd in thyse ydollis / and they answerd / we haue foūden place / in thyse ydolles for vs / For ouerall where Ihesu crist is not named ne hys signe is not shewd / there dwelle we gladly / and by cause whan thyse paynems come to thyse ydolles for to adoure and make sacrefise in the name of vs / thenne we come and dwelle in thyes ydolles / wherfor we pray the man of god that thou sende vs not in in thabysme of helle / And saynt longius said to the peple that there were / what saye ye wyll ye haue thyse deuylles for your goddes and worshyppe them / Or haue ye leuer that I hunte them out of thys world in the name of Ihesu cryst / And the peple sayd wyth an hye voys / Moche grete is the god of crysten peple / holy man we praye the that thou suffre not the deuylles to dwelle in thys cyte / Thenne comanded saynt longius to the deuyllis that they shold yssue out of thys peple in suche wyse that the peple had grete Ioye / and byleued in our lord / A lytyl tyme after / the euyl prouost made saynt longius come to fore hym / and sayd to hym that all the peple were departed & by hys enchaūtement had refused thydollis / yf the kynge knewe it / he shold destroye vs and the cyte also / Afrodisius answerd / how wilt thou yet torm̄ good man whyche hath saued vs and hath don so moche good to the cyte And the prouost said / he hath deceyued vs by enchantrye / Afrodisius said hys god is grete / and hath none euyll in hym / Thenne dyde the prouost cutte out the tongue of afrodisius / wherfore saynt longius sighed vnto god / And anone the prouoste becam blynde / and loste all hys membres / whan afrodifius sawe that / he said / lord god thou art Iuste / And thy Iugement is verytable / And the prouost said to afrodisius / Fayr brother praye to saynt longius that he pray for me / For I haue don yll to hym / And Afrodisius said / haue not I wel told it to the / do nomore so to longius / Seest not thou me speke wythout tongue / And the prouoste sayde / I haue not only l and my body is in grete payne / And saynt longius said / yf thou wylt be hool and guarysshed / put me appertly to deth / And I shal pray for the to our lord after that I shal be deed that he hele y t And anon thenne the prouost dyde do smyte of hys heed / And after he cam and fyll on the body of saynt longius and sayd all in wepyng / Syre I haue synned I knowleche and confesse my fylthe / And anon cam agayn his sight and he receyued helthe of hys body / And buryed honourably the body of saynt longius / And the prouoste byleuyd in Ihesu cryst / And abode in the company of crysten men and thanked god and deyde in good astate / All thys happed in Cesaree of Capadoce to the honour of our lord god / to whom be gyuen laude and glorye in secula seculorum • thys •st myn eyen / but also my herte Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Longius Here begynneth the lif of saynt Maure THe yere that saynt benet deied / he sente seynt Maure / & foure felaws wyth hym in to fraunce / that is to wete fuscinien symplicien Antoninien and constantinen atte prayer of varricam the bysshop of maulx for to founde an abbaye which the said bisshop wold make of hys owen good / And gaf to saynt maure a book in whyche he had wreton the rule of hys hande / And as they passed the montaynes of mongus sourgus one of theyr seruantes fyll fro hys hors vpon a grete stone / and hys lyft fote was all to frusshed / but assone as saynt maure had blessyd it and made hys oryson / he was guarisshed and al hool / After thys he cam in to the chyrche of saynt mauryce / And ther was at entre a blynde man beggyng that had seten there xj yere and was named lieuyn / whyche for the longe vsage that he had ben there / he knew all thoffice of the chirche by heryng that he had lerned ther by wythout more / he coniured saynt maure by the vertue of the martirs that he wold helpe hym / And anone he was guarisshid and had agayn hys sight by hys prayer / And thenne saynt maure comāded hym that he shold serue alle hys lyf in the chyrche as he had don / On a nyght thys holy man and hys felawe herberowed in y e hows of a wydowe / whiche was named themere / the whyche had a sone that was so seke that eche man sayd that he was deed / And thys holy man heled hym / And whan he was hool he said to saynt maure / thou art he / that by thy merytes and by thy teeres hast delyuerd me fro the Iugement where I was in condempned to the fyre of helle / Thus as they helde theyr waye on the good fryday in thabbaye of whyche seynt Romayn was abbot / And saynt maure sayd to saynt Romayn Seynt benet shal departe out of thys world to morowe / On the morn after the hour of tierce as saynt maure was in hys prayers he sawe the waye by whyche saynt benet mounted in to heuen / and he was aourned wyth palles and grete foyson of clerenes / and thys vision sawe two other monkes / Also whan saynt maure & hys felowe cam to orlyance / they herd saye that the bisshop varicam of maulx was deed / And he that was in his place wold not receyue them / Thenne saynt maure and hys felawe wente in to a place that is callyd restis / And there founded and coma and was all to frusshed but saynt maure heled hym anon / And after flocus whyche was one of the grettest frendes of the kynge had hym in so grete reuerence / that he durst not approuche / but yf he bad hym / Thre werkmen that wrought in that hows bygan to saye shrewdly of saynt maure / and saye that he coueyted ouer moche vayne glorye / but anon they be cam so madde that that one of hym lost forthwyth hys lyf / And the other ij to tare them self wyth theyr teeth / the holy man anon put hys hande in theyr mouthes / and made the feende to goo out benethe / And after he reysed the thyrde to lyf whyche had be deed / and comanded hym yf he wold lyue / that he shold nomore entre in to that hows / And thys comāded he for theschewe the fauour of the world / Theodebers kyng of frannce cam for to visite hym / and prayd to saynt maure and the brethern that they wold pray for hym / And he gaf to them of that hows the fee Ryall of that buscage / and alle the rentes therto belongyng / and the townes / On the morn saynt maure wente to see the yeft that the kyng had gyuen / And there he heled one hauyng the paleseye / whyche had be vij yere seke / The second yere that thys hows was founded cam many noble men of the contre whyche demanded that theyr chyldren myght be clothed and receyued in to the religion And ther cam so many that the xxvj yere of the fondacion of thabbaye there were an hondred & fourty brethern / & saynt maure comandeth that they shold abyde in that nombre wythout more or lasse / and not tencreace ne mynuysshe that nombre / After thys And gaf therto the chyef of blason and the toun longchamp therwith / And after thys tyme saynt maure wold nomore yssue out of thabbeye / but he wente and abode in a side of the chyrche of saynt martyn where he had made an hous for hym / and had wyth hym two monkes for to serue hym / but he ordeyned to fore / that bercuses shold be abbot after hym / whan he had ben in hows that ij yere & an half / the deuyl appiered to hym on a tyme / whyche was in hys orysons / and sayd to hym that there shold be grete destruction of hys brethern / but the angele of our lord cam after hym whyche reconforted hym And thenne he cam vnto the brethern and said to them that he and many of them therwithin / shold passe out of thys world / And it happed that with in a moneth after there deyed C and xvj monkes of that abbeye / And of all the nōbre there abode nomoo alyue but xxiiij / And thenne deyde Anthonyn and constantin that were comen wyth hym / A lytyl whyle after deyde saynt maure of the payne of his side the xlj yere after he was comen theder the xviij kalendes of feuerer / And he deyde to fore thaulter of saynt Martyn where he was couerd wyth an heyr / The other of hys felawshyp retorned to mount cassyn / And thus accomplysshyd thys blessyd saynt hys lyf in the tyme of lowys thempereur the second / And the body of saynt maure was born fro thabbaye in Angeo named gaunefuelle for fere of the normans vnto the abbaye of fosses / where hys body is now / whyche Abbaye founded saynt banolanis disciple to saynt collon bain / his feste is the xv day of Ianyuer •e fyrst an hows for to adoure god there in thonour of saynt martyn / •ded that he shold be buryed therin A clerke that was there named langyso fyl doun of an hie steyer vpon an hepe of stones / •lotaire the kynge cam in to thys abbeye / Here endeth the lyf of saynt Maure Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Patryke and thynterpretacion of hys name PAtryke is as moche to saye as knowleche / For by the wyll of god he knewe many of the secretes of heuen and of the Ioyes there / And also he sawe a partye of the paynes of helle / ¶Of Seynt Patryke SAynt Patryke was born in brytayne whyche is called Englond / And was lerned atte Rome and there flourid in vertues / And after departed out of the partyes of ytalye where he had longe dwellyd and cam home in to hys coutre in walis named pendyac / And entred in to a fayr and Ioyous contre called the valeye Rosyne / To whom thangele of god appiered & said / O patryke this see ne bysshopriche god hath not { pro } uyded to the but vnto one not yet born / but shal xxx yere here after be born / And so he left that contre and Saylled ouer in to yrlonde / And as chester sayth in polycronycon the fourth booke the xxix chapytre that saynt patryke fader was named caprum which was a preest & a dekens sone whyche was called fodum And saynt patrykes moder was named conches martyns suster of fraūce / in his baptesme he was named Sucate / and saynt germayn callid hym magonius / & celestinus the pope named hym patryke / that is as moche to saye as fader of the cytezeyns / Sanyt patryke on a day as he prechyd a sermon of the paciēce & suffraūce of the passyon of our lord Ihesu cryst / to the kyng of the contre / he leued vpon hys croche or croos / And it happed by auēture / that he sette the ende of the croche or his staf vpon the kynges foot / & perced his foot with the pike whiche was sharp byneth / the kynge hath supposed y e saynt patryke had don it wetyngly / for to meue hym y e sonner to pacyenee and to the feythe of god / But Whan saynt Patryke aperceyued it / he was moche abasshed / and by hys prayers he helyd the kynge / And furthermore he Impetred & gate grace of our lord / that no venemous beest myght lyue in al the contre / And yet vnto this day is no venemous beest in alle yrelond / ¶ After it happed on a tyme that a man of that contre stale a sheep whiche bylonged to his neyghbour / where vpon Saynt Patryke admonested the peple / that who someuer had taken hit / shold delyuer it ageyn wythin seuen dayes / whan al the peple were assemblyd wythin the chyrche / & the man whiche had stolen it made no semblaunte / to rendre ne delyuer ageyn thys sheep / Thenne saynt Patryke commaunded by the vertu of god that the sheep shold blete and crye in the bely of hym that had eten hit / And so happed it / that in the presence of al the peple the sheep cryed and bleted in the bely of hym that had stolen hit / And the man that was culpable repented hym of his trespace / And the other fro thenne forthon kepte them fro stelyng of sheep fro ony other man / Also saynt Patrike was wonte for to worshyp and do reuerence vnto al the crosses deuoutelye that he myght see / But on a tyme tofore the sepulcre of a paynym stood a fayre crosse / whiche he passed and went forth by as he had not seen hit / And he was demaunded of his felawes / why he sawe not that crosse / And thenne he prayed to god he sayd for to knowe whos hit was / & he sayd he herde a voys vnder the erthe sayeng / thou sawest it not / bycause I am a paynym that am buryed here / & am vnworthy that the signe of the crosse shold stonde there / wherfore he made the sygne of the crosse to be taken thens / On a tyme as saynt patryke preched in yrelond the feythe of Ihesu crist & dyd but lytel prouff yte by his predycacion / for he coude not conuerte the euyl rude / and wylde peple / And he prayed to our lord Ihesu cryst that he wold shewe them somme signe openly ferdeful and gastful / by whiche they myght be conuerted / and be repentaūt god Saynt Patryke made in therthe a grete cercle with his staffe / & anone therthe after the quantyte of the cercle openyd / And there appyered a grete pytte and a deep / & saynt patryke by the reuelacion of god vnderstood that there was a place of purgatorye / In to whiche who someuer entred therin / he shold neuer haue other penaunce ne fele none other payne / & there was shewed to hym that many shold entre whiche shold neuer retourne ne come ageyn / And they that shold retourne shold abyde but fro one morne to another and nomore / And many entred that came not ageyn / As touchyng this pytte or hole whyche is named saynt Patrikes purgatorye / Somme holde opynyon that the second patryke whiche was an abbot and no bysshop / that god shewed to hym this place of purgatorye / but certeynly suche a place there is in yrelond wherein many men haue been / and yet dayly go on in / and come ageyn / and somme haue had there meruayllous vysions / and seen grysly and horryble paynes of whome there been bookes maad / as of Tundale and other / Thenne this holy man saynt patryke the bysshop lyued tyl he was Cxxij yere olde / and was the first that was bysshop in yrelonde / and deyed in aurelyus ambroses tyme that was kyng of brytayn / In hys tyme was the abbot columba otherwyse named colinkyllus & saynt bride whom Saynt Patryke professyd and veylled And she ouer lyued hym fourty yere Alle these thre holy sayntes were buryed in vlster in the cyte of Dunence / as it were in a caue wyth thre

second that he had graunte of our lord god / that none yrysshe man shal abyde the comyng of antecryst / The iij wonder is redde of hys purgatorye whyche is more referred to the lasse saynt Patryk thabbot / And this holy abbot by cause he founde the people of that londe rebelle / he went out of yrlond & came in to englond to the abbey of glastenberye where he deyed on a saynt bartylmewes day / He flouryd about the yere of our lord viijCL / & the holy bysshoy deyed the yere of our lord foure hondred iiij score & x in the hondred and xxij yere of his age / to whome praye we that he praye for

in this lyf / Or for as moche as he deseruyd for to haue blessynges or benediccions perpetuel / And the holy doctour Saynt gregory wrote his lyf / ¶Of saynt benet thabbot TAynt benet was borne of the prouynce of Nurcia / And was sente to Rome for to studye / but in hys Infancye he lefte the scoles and wente in to a deserte / and his nouryce whych tenderly loued hym wēt alweye wyth hym tyl they came to a place named offyde / And there she borowed a vessel for to pourge or wyne we whete / but the vessel fyl to therthe by neclygence / and was broken in two peces / And whan saynt Benet sawe his nouryce wepe / he had grete pyte / & made his prayers to almyghty god & after made hit also hole as it had been tofore / Thenne they of the contre tooke hit / and henge hit on the fronte of the chyrche in wytnesse of one soo fayre a myracle / Thenne lefte saynt benet hys nourice and fledde secretely and came in to an hermytage / where he was neuer knowen of no man but of a monke named romayn whiche mynystred to hym mete for to ete / And bycause that there was no waye fro the monasterye of romayn vnto the pytte where Saynt Benet was / he knytte the loof in a corde & so lete hit doun to hym / And bycause he shold here whā romayn shold lete doun the breed / he bonde a belle on the corde and by the sowne therof / he receyued his breed / But the deuyl hauyng enuye of the charitee of that one / and of the refeccion of that other / cast a stone and brake the belle / but neuerthelesse Romayn lefte not to mynystre hym / It happed that there was a preest on an estern day that had arayed his dyner for hym self / and our lord appered to hym and sayd / thou ordeynest for thy self delycious metes / and my seruaunt deyeth for hunger in suche a pytte and named hym the place / Thenne the preest aroos and bare his mete wyth hym / & sought soo longe that he fonde Saynt benet in grete payne / whan he had founden hym he sayd to hym / Aryse and take thy mete and refeccion / For it is ester day / He answerd I knowe wel that hit is the feste of paske / bycause that I see the / The preest sayd to hym Certeynly thys day is the day of ester and saynt benet wyst hyt not / by cause he had dwellyd there so longe and so ferre fro people / Thenne sayd they graces and made the benedyccion and toke theyr refeccyon / It happed after thys that a blacke byrde that is called a merle came on a tyme to saynt benet / and peckyd with his bylle at his vysage / And greuyd and noyed hym so moche that he coude haue no reste for it / and coude not put it from hym / but assone as he had made the signe of the crosse / anone the birde vanysshyd away / And after that cam to hym a grete temptaciō of the flessh by the whyche the deuyl tempted hym in shewyng hym a womā and brente sore and was enflamed in hys corage / but anon he cam agayn to hym self / and after he despoylled hym self all naked and wente emong thornes and walowed emong the nettels so that his body was torn and payned by whyche he heled the woundes of his herte / Thenne after that tyme / he felte nomore temptacion of hys flessh / ¶ It happed that thabbot of a monastery was deed / And for the good renom said that hys condicions and maners were not acordyng to theyres / Notwythstondyng he was vaynquysshyd and so Instauntly requyred / that atte laste he consented But whan he sawe they lyuyd not ne were not ruled acordyng to theyr religion and rewle / he repreued and correctyd them vigorously / And whan they sawe that they myght not doo their wylles vnder hym / They gaf hym venym medlyd wyth wyn for to drynke / but saynt benet made the signe of the crosse ouer it and blessyd it / and anon the vessell brake in pieces whyche was of glasse / whan saynt benet thēne knesoe that in that vesselle was mortal drynke / whyche myght not abyde ne suffre the signe of the crosse / he roos vp and sayd god haue mercy on you fair brethern / I sayde to you wel atte begynnyng / that my condicions and maners apparteyne not to youres / Fro hensforth gete to you another fader / For I may no lenger dwelle here / Thenne wente he agayn to deserte where god shewed for hym many signes & myracles / and founded there two abbeyes / Now it happed that in one of thyes two abbeyes was a monke that myght not endure longe in prayers / And whan the other of hys felawys were in prayer / he wold goo out of the chyrche / Thenne thabbot of that abbaye shewd thys to saynt benet / And anone he wente for to see yf it were trewe / And whan he cam he sawe that the deuyl in lyknes of a lytyl bla chy drewe hym out of the chyrche by hys cowle / Thenne •d sayd saynt benet to the abbot / and to saynt maure / See ye not hym that draweth hym out / they sayd naye / thenne sayd late vs praye to god that we may see hym / whan they had made theyr prayers / saynt maure sawe hym / but the abbot myght not see hym The next day saynt benet toke a rodde and bete the monke / And thenne he abode in prayer / lyke as the deuyl had be beten / and durst nomore come & drawe hym awaye / And fro than forthon he abode in prayer / & contynued therin Of the xij abbeyes that saynt benet had founded / thre of them stoode on hye Roches so that they myght haue no water but by grete labour / Thenne cam the monkes to hym & prayd hym that he wold sette thyse abbeyes in som̄e other place / by cause they had grete defaute of water / Thenne wente saynt benet aboute the montayne & made hys orysons & prayers moche deuoutly / and whan he had longe prayd he sawe thre stones in a place for a signe / And on the morn whan the monkes cam for to praye / he said to them / goo ye to suche a place where ye shal fynde thre stones / and there dygge a lityl & ye shal fynde water / Our lord can wel prouyde for you water / And they wente and fonde the montaygne all swetyng / where as the thre stones were / And there they digged & anon they fonde water so grete habundaunce that it suffysed to them / and ran doun fro the toppe of the hille vnto bynethe in to the valeye / It happed on a tyme that a man hewe buysshes & thornes aboute the monasterye / And hys axe or instrument of yron that he hewe sprang out of the helue & fyll in to a depe water / thenne the man cryed and sorowed for hys tool / and saynt benet sawe that he was ouer anguysshid therfore / & toke the helue & threwe it after in to the pytte / And anon the yron cam vp & bygā to s •e of thys holy man saynt benet / All the monkes of thabbaye gaf theyr voys and electe saynt benet for theyr abbot / But he accorded not therto ne agreed to them / For he •k •ym̄e tyl that it entred in to the helue / In thabbaye of saynt benet was a chyld named placidus whyche wente to the Ryuer for to drawe water / And hys foot slode so that he fyl in to the Ryuer whyche was moche deep / and anon the Ryuer bare hym forth more than a bowe shote / And whan saynt benet whyche was in hys studye knew it / he called to saynt maure and sayd that ther was a chyld whyche was a monke that was aboute to be drowned and bad hym go to helpe hym / And anon saynt maure ranne vpon the water lyke as it had ben on drye ground and hys feet drye / ¶ And toke vp the chyld by the heer / And drewe hym to londe / And after whan he cam to saynt benet / he sayd that it was not by hys meryte / but by the vertue of hys obedyence / Ther was a preest named florentyn / whyche had enuye on saynt benet / and he sente to hym a loof of bred enuenymed / After whan saynt benet had thys loof / he knewe by the Inspiracion / that it was enuenymed / he gaf it to a rauen that was wonte to take hys fedyng of saynt benettes hand / And comaunded hym to bere it vnto suche a place that nomā shold fynde it / Thenne the rauen made semblaunt for tobeye to the comandement of saynt benet / but he durste not touche it for the venym / and fledde aboute it / howlyng and cryeng / Saynt benet sayd to hym take thys brede hardyly and bere it away / Atte laste the rauen bare it awaye in to suche a place / that ther was neuer herd tydynges therof after / And cam agayn the thyrde day after / and toke hys refection of saynt benettes hand / as he was wonte to doo to fore / whan thys preest Florentyn sawe that he coude not slee saynt benet / he enforced hym to slee spyrytuelly the sowles of hys dyscyples / he toke seuen maydens all naked / & sente them in to the gardyn to daunse & to carolle for to meue the monkes to temptacion / whan saynt benet sawe the malyce of florentyn / he had fere of hys dyscyples / and sente hem out of that place / whan florentyn sawe that saynt benet and hys monkes wente out he demened grete Ioye and made grete feste / And anō the soler fyl vpon hym and slewe hym sodenly whan saynt maure sawe that florentyn was deed / he ranne after saynt benet / and called hym sayeng / come agayn / for florentyn that hath don so moche harme to you is deed / whan saynt benet herde thys / he was sory for the perryllous deth of florentyn & by cause saynt maure was glad for the deth of hys enemye as hym semed he enioyned hym penaunce therfor / After thys he wente to mount Cassyn where he had another grete aduesarye / For in the place where that appolyn was adoured / he made an oratorye of saynt Iohan baptyst / and conuerted alle the contre aboute to the crysten fayth / wherof the deuyl was so tormented / that he appyered to saynt benet alle blacke and ranne vpon hym wyth open mouth and throte / And had hys eyen alle enflammed / And sayd to hym / Benet / Benet / And saynt Benet answerd not / the deuyl sayd / Cursid and not blessyd why haue I so moche persecucion / ¶ Hyt happed on a tyme that as the monkes shold lyft a stone for a werke of an edefyce / they myght not meue it / thenne ther assembled a grete multitude of peple / and yet they alle myght not lyfte it / But anone as saynt Benet had blessyd it / they lift it a non / Thenne apparceyued they that the deuyl was vpon it / and caused it to be so heuy / And whan they had a lytyl made the walle hye / the deuyll appyerid to saynt Benet / and bad hym goo see them that edeffyed / thenne saynt Benet sente to hys monkes / & comanded that they shold kepe them wel / For the deuyll wente to destroye them / but er the messager cam to them the deuyl had throwen doun a parte of the wall and had therwith slayn a yong monke / Thenne they brought the monke alle to brused in a sack to saynt Benet / And anon saynt benet made vpon hym the signe of the crosse and blessyd hym / and reysed hym to lyf / and sente hym to the werke agayn / A laye man of honest lyf had acustome ones in the yere to come to saynt benet all fastyng / & on a tyme as he cam ther was one that bare mete accompayned wyth hym / And desired that he wold ete with hym but he refused it / After he prayd hym the second tyme / and yet he refused it / and sayd he wold ete no mete tyl he cam to saynt benet / At the third tyme he fonde a fayr fontayne / and a moche delytable place / And began sore to desire hym to ete wyth hym / And atte laste he consented and ete / And whan he cam to saynt benet / he said to hym / where hast thou eten / which answerd I haue eten a lytyl / O fayr brother the deuyl hath deceyued the / but he coude not deceyue the fyrst ne the second tyme / but the thyrd tyme he hath surmounted the / thenne the good man kneled doun to the feet of saynt benet and confessyd hym of hys trespaas / Attila the kyng of gothes wold ones preue yf saynt benet had the sperite of prophecye / and sente to hym hys seruaunt and dyde do araye hym with precious robes / and delyuerd to hym a grete companye as he had ben the kyng hym self / whan saynt benet sawe hym come he sayd to hym fayr sone / doo of that thou werest it is not thyn / & the man fyl doun anon to the ground by cause he mocqued the holy man and deyde anon / A knyght that was vexed with the deuyl was brought to saynt benet for to be heled / And saynt benet put hym out / and after sayde to the knyght / Goo and fro hensforth ete nomore flessh / and goo nomore to none ordre / For what day thou goost & takest ordres the deuyl shal reentre in to the / Thys knyght helde hym longe tyme wythout takyng ony / tyl atte laste he sawe yonger than he / that wente to ordres / And had forgete the wordes of saynt benet / and toke ordres / And anon the deuyl entryd in to hys body / and tormented hym tyl he deyde / Ther was a man that sente to saynt benet ij flagons of wyn but he that bare them hydde that one / And presented that other wythout more / whā saynt benet had receyued the presente / he thanked hym moche / and sayd to hym / Fayr brother take good hede how y u shalt doo wyth that whyche thou hast hyd / and drynke not therof For thou knowest not what is therin Thenne he was asshamed and so confused wente from hym / And whan he cam to the place where he had hyd it / he wold wyte what was therin / lyke as saynt benet had told to hym / and bowed it a lytyl / and anon a serpent yssued out / ¶ It happed on a tyme that saynt benet ete / and a yong man whyche was sone to a grete lord helde to hym a candel / and began to thynke in hys herte / who is thys that I serue / I am sone vnto a grete man / hyt apperteyneth not that one so gentyl a man as I am / be seruant to hym / whan saynt benet sawe by experience the pryde that aroos in thys monke / he called another monke / and made hym to holde the candell / And after sayd to hym / what is that thou hast / blesse thy herte brother blesse it / god forgyue it the / Now thou shalt serue me nomore / goo in to thy cloystre and reste the there / Ther was a man of the kyng of gothes whyche was named Zallas which tormented ouer cruelly the crysten men by cause he was of the secte of tharryēs in suche wise that where he fonde clerkes or monkes he slewe them / Thenne it happed on a day that he tormented a uylayn or a carle for the couetyse of hys good / whan the carle sawe that he wold take all / he gaf all that euer he had to saynt benet / Thenne left Zallas to tormente hym a lytyl / but he bonde hym wyth the reynes of hys brydell / & droof hym to fore / and he rode after tyl that he cam to thabbaye of saynt benet and bad hym that he shold shewe to hym this benet / whan he cam theder he saw saynt benet stonde to fore the gate allone & studyed in a book / thēne sayd the vylayne to the traūt / Loo ther is benet that thou demaundest after / whan Zallas had loked on hym cruelly lyke he had ben acustomed he had supposed to haue delt wyth hym / lyke as he had doo wyth other crysten men And sayd to saynt benet / Aryse vp anone and delyuer to me the goodes of thys carle whyche thou hast by the / whan saynt benet herde he lyft vp a lytyl hys eyen / and be And anon by grete meruaylle hys armes were vnbounden / And whan the carle sawe hym self vnbounden / he stode to fore the tyrant Appertely wythout drede / And anon Zallas fyl doun to the feet of saynt benet and recomanded hym to hys prayers / And neuer for al thys left saynt benet to rede on hys book / but called hys monkes and comāded that his mete shold be brought to hym / and the monkes dyde so / And sith bare it away / Thenne admonested saynt Benet the tyraunt and sayd to hym that he shold leue hys cruelte and hys wodenes / And he de { per } ted & neuer after that day / he demanded of vylayn ony good / ne of the man that saynt benet had vnboūden only by his sight / ¶ It happed ouer alle champayne where as he dwellyd / that so grete famyne was in the contre that moch peple deyed for hungre / thenne alle the breed of thabbaye faylled / and ther was wythin but v loues for all the couent / whan saynt benet sawe that they were abasshyd / he began debonairly to chastyse & warne them that they shold haue theyr hertes on hye to god and sayd to them / Wherfore are ye in so grete mesease for brede / yf ye haue no ne thys day ye shal haue to morn / now it happed that on the morn they fonde at theyr yate two honderd muddes of mele / whyche were proprely sente fro god / For neuer man wyst / fro whens they cam / whan the monkes sawe that they thanked god / and lerned that they ought not doubte / ne of habundaunce ne of pouerte / ••lde the carle that was to fore hym / ¶ It happed on a tyme that saynt benet sente hys monkes for to edefye an abbaye / and sayd that at a certayn day he wold come see them and shewe them what they shold doo / Thenne the nyght to fore that he had sayd to come / he appyered to the maystre and to hys monkes / and shewed to them alle the places that they shold bylde / but they byleuyd not thye vysion / and supposed it had be but a dreme / Thenne whan they sawe that he cam not they retorned and sayd to hym / Fayr fader we haue abyden that thou sholdest haue comen to vs / lyke as thou promysest vs thenne answerd he what is that ye saye remembre not ye that I appyeryd to you that nyght that I promysed you / & enseygned and told how ye shold doo Goo your way and doo in suche wyse as I deuysed to you in the vysion / ¶Ther were two nonnes nyghe vnto hys monasterye whyche were of moche noble lygnage / whyche were moche talkatyf and restrayned not wel theyr tongues / but tormented ouermoche hym that gouerned them / ¶ And whan he had shewed this to saynt benet / he sente them word / that they shold better kepe scilence and rule theyr tongues / or he wold curse them / but they for alle that wold not leue it / And so anon after they deyde and were buryed in the chyrche / And whan the deken cryed in thende of the masse / that they that were acursed shald goo out of the chyrche / the nourisse that had nourisshed them / and that euery day had offred for them / byhelde and sawe that whan the deken sange so they yssued out of theyr sepulcres and wente out of the chyrche / ¶ And whan saynt benet knewe herof / he offred for them hym self and assoylled them / Thenne after that whan the deken said so as a fore / they neuer yssued out after / as theyr noucices had seen them ¶Ther was a monke goon out for to see hys fader and moder wythout lycence and blessyng of hys abbotte / And the day after he cam theder he deyd / And whan he was buryed in therthe / therthe caste hym out agayn And so it dyde twyes / thenne cam the fader and moder to saynt benet / and told hym how the erthe threwe hym and wold not receyue hym / and prayd that he wold blesse hym / Thenne toke he the blessyd sacrament / and made it to be leyde on the breste of the corps / And whan they had doon so they buried hym / and therthe drewe hym nomore out / but receyued the body & helde it / ¶Ther was a monke that coude not abide in the monastery & prayd so moche to saynt benet / that he lete hym goo & was all angry / and anon as he was out of thabbaye / he fonde a dragon with open mouth / And whan he sawe hym he had fere that he wold haue deuoured hym / & cried lowde / Come hether and helpe me / come hether / For this dragon wil deuoure me / thēne the monkes ranne / but they sawe no dragon / and brought agayn the monk trēblyng & syghyng thenne the monke promysed that he neuer wold departe fro thabbaye ¶ In a tyme ther was in that centre a grete famyne / and all that euer saynt benet myght gete & haue / he gaue it to the poure peple / in so moche that he had nomore in the abbaye but a lytyl oyle / and he comanded yet to the celerer to gyue it to a poure man the celerer vnderstode hym wel / but he gaf it not / by cause ther was nomore in the couent / And whan saynt benet knewe it he toke the vessel / and cast it out of the wyndow & was of glasse / & it felle on a stone / & brake not / thenne he repreued the celerer of inobedience / & of a lityl hope that he had in god / & after he wente vnto hys prayers / And anon a grete empty tonne that was there / was full of oylle in so moche that it ranne ouer / ¶ It happed an other day that saynt benet wente to visite hys suster named scolastica / And as they satte atte table / She prayd her brother that he wold abyde there al that nyght but he in no wyse wold graunte her / and sayd he myght not lye out of hys cloyster / ¶ And whan she sawe that he wold not graunte to her to abyde / she enclyned her heed and made her prayers to our lord / ¶ And anon it began to thōdre & to lyghtne / & the ayer to wexe derke / whyche to fore was fayr & clere / and a grete rayn fyl doun / so that for nothyng he myght departe / And lyke as she wepte wyth her eyen / right so forthwyth the rayne and storme cam / and thenne she lyft vp her heed / Thēne saynt benet said to his suster / almyghty god forgyue you that ye haue don For ye haue letted me that I may not departe hens / And she said / Fayr brother god is more curtoys than ye be / For ye wold not accepte my prayer / but god hath herd me / now goo yf ye may And thenne saynt benet abode there / all the nyght spekyng of god bytwene hym and hys suster / wythout slepyng tyl they were bothe eased / On the morn saynt benet wente to hys abbaye / And on the thyrde day after he lyft vp hys eyen to heuen / and sawe the sowle of hys suster mounte vp in to heuen in the lyknes of a douue / And anon he dyde the body of her to be brought to hys abbaye / and dyde it to be buryed in hys tombe / whyche he had do made for hym self / On a nyght as saynt benet was in hys pyayer at a wyndowe / he sawe the sowle of saynt germayn bysshop of capes mounte in to heuen / And lyke as a light sodayne that enlumyneth all the derknesses of the world / so the light of that sowle gaf a grete light / And after he knewe that the sowle of saynt germayn passed that same hour / After thys whan tyme cam / that saynt benet hym self shold de { per } te out of this world he shewd it to hys monkes sixe dayes to fore / and dyde do make hys pytte / and after that a feuer toke hym strongly / whyche helde hym euery day / and atte the sixthe day / he dyde hym self to be born to the chyrche / And there receyued the body of our lord Ihesu cryst And after emong the handes of hys dyscyples / hys owen handes lyftyng vp to heuen / in makyng hys oryson he rendryd hys sowle vnto hys creatour / The same hour was a reuelacion shewd to two monkes / For they sawe a way to heuen all couerd with palles & man tellis of gold / alle ful of torches brennyng / whyche enlumyned alle the heuen / whyche cam fro the celle of saynt benet vnto heuen / And ther was a mā in a fayr habyte / to whome thyse monkes demaunded / what way that was And he answerd that it was the way by whyche saynt benet mounted vp to heuen / ¶ Thenne the body of saynt benet was buryed in the oratorye that he had made of saynt Iohan / where as was wonte to be the aulter of appollyn the xere of our lord vC and xviij / To whom late vs praye deuoutly that he praye to our lord for vs that we may haue grace after thys lyf to come to euerlastyng blysse in heuen / Amen / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt benet Abbote Here next foloweth the lyf of saynt Cuthberd of durham Saynt cuthberd was born in englond / And whan he was viij yere old our lord shewd for hym a fayr myracle / for to drawe hym to his loue For on a tyme as he pleyed atte the balle wyth other chyldren / Sodenly ther stode emonge them a fayr yong child of the age of iij yere / which was the fayrest creature that euer they behelde / And anon he sayd to cuthberd / good broder vse no suche vayne plaies ne sette not thy herte on them / But for all that cuthberd toke none heed to his wordes / And thenne thys chyld fyll doun and made grete heuynes / wepte sore / and wronge hys hondes / And thenne Cuthberd and the other chyldren lefte theyr playe and comforted hym and demaunded of hym why he made suche sorow / Thenne the chyld sayd to Cuthbert / all myn heuynesse is only for the / by cause thou vsist suche vayne playes / for our lord hath chosen the to be an heed of holy chyrche / And thenne sodenly he vanysshyd away / And thenne he knewe veryly / that it was an Angele sente fro our lord to hym / And fro thenne forthon he lefte all suche vayne playes / & neuer vsed them more / and began to lyue holyly And thenne he desired of hys fader / that he myght be sette to scole / and anon he drewe hym to parfyght lyuyng / for he was euer in his prayers nyght and daye / And most desired of our lord to doo that which myght plese hym and eschewe that shold dysplese hym / and he lyued so vertuosly and holyly that all the peple had Ioye of hym / and within a whyle after Aydanus the bisshop deyde / And as cuthberd kept shepe in the felde / he lokyd vp ward and sawe angellis bare the sowle of Aydanus the bysshop to heuen with grete melodye / And after that saynt cuthberd wold nomore kepe sheep but wēte anon to thabbaye of geru And there he was a monke / of whome all the couēte were right glad / and thanked our lord that had sente hym theder / For he lyued there ful holyly in fastyng and grete penaunce doyng / And atte last he had the gowte in hys knees whiche he had taken of cold in knelyng vpon the cold stones / whan he said hys prayers in suche wyse that hys knee hegan to swelle / And the synewys of hys legge were shronke / that he myght neyther goo ne stratche out hys legge / but euer he toke it ful paciently / and sayd whan it plesith our lord / it shal passe away / And within a whyle after his brethern for to doo hym cōfort bare hym in to the felde / And there they mette wyth a knyght / whyche sayd late me see and handle thys cuthbertis legge / And thenne whan he had felt it wyth hys handes / he bad them take the mylk of a cowe of one colour / and the Iuse of smal plātayn / And fair whete flour And seethe them alle to gydre / And make therof a playster / & leye it therto / and it wyl make hym hool / And assone as they had so doon he was perfightly hool / And thenne he thanked our lord ful mekely / And after he knewe by reuelaciō that it was an angele sente by our lord to hele hym / of hys grete sekenes and dysease / And thabbot of that place sente hym / to aselle of theyres to be hosteler / for to receyue / there ghestes / and do them confort / And sone after our lord shewd there a fayr myracle for hys seruaunt seynt cuthberd / For Angellis come to hym oftymes in liknes of other ghestis whom he receyued and seruyd dylygently wyth mete and drynke / and other necessaryes / On a tyme ther come ghestis to hym whom he receyued / and wente in to the houses of offyce for to serue them / And whan he cam agayn they were goon / And wente after for to calle and coude not espye them / ne knowe the stappes of theyr feet how wel that it was thenne a snowe / and whan he retorned he fonde the table leide And theron thre fayr whyte loues of brede all hoot whiche were of meruayllous beaute and swetenes / For alle the place smelled of the swete odour of them / Thenne he knewe wel that the Angellis of our lord had ben there / and rendryd thankynges to our lord that he had sente to hym hys angellys for to conforte hym / and euery nyght whā his brethern were a bedde he wold goo and stonde in the cold water al naked vp to the chyn tyl it were myd nyght / And thenne he wold yssue out Anth whā he come to londe / he myght not stonde for feblenes / and fayntnes / but oft fyll doun to the ground / And on a tyme as he laye thus / ther cam ij otters whyche licked euery place of his body / and thenne wente agayn to the water that they cam fro / And thenne saynt cuthberd aroos all hool & wente to hys celle agayn / and wente to matyns wyth hys brethern / but hys brethern knewe nothyng of hys stondyng thus euery nyght in the see to the chyn / but atte laste one of hys brethern espyed it and knewe his doyng and told hym therof / but saynt cuthberd charged hym to kepe it secrete / and telle noman therof duryng his lyf / And after thys within a whyle the bysshop of durham deyed / And saynt cuthberd was electe & sacred bysshop in his stede after hym And euer after he lyued full holyly vnto hys deth / And by his prechyng & ensample gyuyng he brought moche peple to good lyuyng / And to fore hys deth / he lefte his bysshopriche / And wente in to the holy Iland / where he lyuyd an holy and solytary lyf vnto that And was buryed at durham / And after translated and the body leyd in a fayr and honourable shryne where as yet dayly our lerd sheweth for hys seruaunt there many fair and grete myracles / wherfore late vs pray vnto this holy saynt / that he pray for vs / •us / •e beyng ful of vertues rendryd his soule vnto almyghty god / Here foloweth the fest of the anunciacion or salutacion of thangel gabriel to our lady THe feste of thys day is called thanunciacion of our lady / for on thys day thaungel gabriel shewed to the glorious virgyne marye the comyng of the blessyd sone of god / That is to wete how he ought to come in to y e gloryouse vyrgyne / and take in her nature / and flesshe humayne for to saue the world It was wel thyng resonable that than gel shold come to the glorious virgyn marye / For lyke as Eue by thenhortyng of the deuyl / gaf her cousente to doo the synne of Inobedyence to our perdicion / Ryght so by the gretyng of thangel gabryel and by exhortyng the glorious virgyne marye / gaf her consentyng to hys message by obedyence to our saluacion / wherfor lyke as the first woman was cause of our dampnacion / So was the blessyd virgyne marye begynnyng of our redempcion / whan that thangel gabriel was sente for to shewe thyncarnacyon of our sauyour Ih̄u crist he fonde her al one enclosed in her chambre / lyke as saynt bernard sayth / In whyche the maydens & virgynes ought to abyde in theyr howses / wythout rennyng abroode out openly / And they ought also to flee the wordes of men / of whyche theyr honour and good renomee myght be lassed or hurte / And thangele said to the gloryous vyrgyne marye / I salewe the ful of grace / the lord is wyth the / Ther is not founden in scripture in no { per } te suche a salewyng And it was brought fro heuen vnto the glorious virgyne marye / whyche was the first woman that euer in the world offrid to god first her virgynyte / And thaungele said to her after / Thou shalt be blessyd aboue alle other Wymen / For thou shalt escape the malediction that all other wymen haue in chyldyng in synne and in sorowe / and thou shal be moder of god / and shal abyde a pure virgyne and clene / and our blessyd lady was moche abasshid of thys salutacion / and thought in her self the maner therof / Thys was a good maner of a vyrgyne / that so wysely held her stylle / and spack not / and shewyng example to virgynes whiche ought not lyghtly to speke / ne without aduys ne manere / to answere / And whan thangele knewe that for thys salutacion she was tymerous and abasshed / A none he repeased her sayeng / Marye be nothyng aferd / For thou hast founden sothly grace atte god For thou art chosen aboue alle wymen for to receyue his blessyd sone / and be moder to god / and moyen and aduocate for to sette peas bytwene god & man for to destroye the deth and bryng the lyf / O thou that arte a vyrgyne sayth saynt Ambrose / lerne of marye to be manerd and fere ful to all men / lerne to be stylle / & teschewe alle dssolucions / Marye was aferd of the salutacion of thangel / the whyche sayd Thou shalt conceyue / and brynge forth a sone / And thou shalt calle hys name Ihesus / and he shal be callid the sone of god / And marye sayd to the angele / In what maner may thys be that thou sayst / For I haue purposed in myn herte / that I shal neuer know man / And yet I neuer knewe none / how thenne shal I haue a chyld agayn the cours of nature / and may abyde a vyrgyne / Thenne the Angele enformed her / and began to saye / how her vyrgynyte shold be saued in the conceyuyng of the sone of god / & answerd to her in thys maner / The holy ghoost shal come in to the / whyche shal make the to conceyue / the maner how thou shalt conceyue / thou shalt knowe better than I shal conne saye / For that shal be the werke of the holy ghoost / which of thy blood and of thy flessh shal forme purely in the / the body of the chyld that thou shalt b And the vertue of god souerayne shal shadowe the in suche wyse / that thou shalt neuer fele in the ony brennyng ne couetyse carnall / and shal purge thyn herte fro all desires temporell / and yet shal the holy ghoost shadowe wyth the mantel corporel / that the blessyd sone of god shal be hydde in the / and of the / for to couere the right excellente clarte of hys dyuynyte / so that by thys vmbre or shadowe may be knowen and seen hys dygnyte / lyke as huge of saynt victor / and saynt bernard saye / After thangele said / And for as moche as thou shalt conceyue of the holy ghoost / and not of man / the child that shal be born of the shal be called the sone of god / yet of thys concepcion whyche is aboue nature / the Angele sayd to her thys example / Lo elyzabeth thy cosyne whyche is barayne hath conceyued a chyld in her age / For ther is nothyng impossyble to god / whyche is almyghty / Thenne sayd the gloryouse virgyne marye / to thangele the answere for whyche he was comen / lo thandmayde of god / he doo to me that he hath ordeyned after thy wordes She hath gyuen to vs example to be humble whan { pro } speryte of hye Rychesse cometh to vs / For the first word that she spack or said whan she was made moder of god and quene of heuen / that was that she callid her self ancylle or handmayde / and not lady / moche peple is humble in lowe estate and but fewe in hye estate / that is to wete in grete estates / and therfore is humylyte more preysed in them that ben grete in estate / Assone as she sayd loo here the handmayde of god late it ben doo to me after thy wordes / Thomas in compendio / In that same tyme that she had thus gyuen her assente to the angele / She conceyued in her Ihesu cryst whyche in that same hour was in her parfight man and parfight god in one persone / and as wyse as he was in heuen / or whan he was xxx yere old / Thys blessyd Anunciacion happened the xxv day of the moneth of marche / On whyche day happend also as wel to fore as after thyse thynges that here after be named / ¶ On that same day Adam the first man was created / and fyl in to orygynal synne by inobedience / and was put out of paradys terrestre / After thangele shewed the concepcion of our lord to the gloryouse virgyne marye / ¶ Also that same day of the moneth kaym slewe Abel hys broder / Also melchesedech made offryng to god of brede and wyn in the presence of Abraham / Also on the same day Abraham offrid ysaac hys sone / That same day saynt Iohan baptyst was byheded / And saynt peter was that day delyuerd out of pryson / And saynt Iames the more that day byheded of herode / And our lord Ihesu cryst was on that day crucyfyed / wherfore / that is a day of grete reuerence / Of the salutacion that thangel brought to the gloryouse virgyne / ¶We rede an example of a noble knyght / whyche for tamēde hys lyf / gaf and rendryd hym self in to an abbaye of cysteauls / and for as moche as he was no clerke / ther was assygned to hym a maystre for to teche hym and to be with the brethern clerkes / but he coude nothyng lerne in long tyme that he was there sauf thyse two wordes / Aue maria / whyche wordes he had so sore enprynted in his herte / that alleway he had them in his mouthe whersomeuer he was / Atte last he deyde and was buryed in the chyrcheyerde of the brethern / It happed after that vpon the buryels grewe a right fayr flourdelis / And in euery flour was wreton in lettres of gold Aue maria / of whyche myracle alle the brethern were amerueylled / And they dyde open the sepulture / and fonde that the rote of thys flour delis cam out of the mouth of the sayd knyght / And anon they vnderstode that our lord wold haue hym honoured for the grete deuocion that he had to saye these wordes Aue maria / ¶ Another knyght ther was that had a fayr place by side the hye waye where moche peple passed whom he robbed as moche as he myght and so he vsed hys lyf / But he had a good custome / For euery day he salewed the gloryouse vyrgyne marye in sayeng Aue maria / And for no labour he left not to grete our lady as sayd is / It happed that an holy man passed by hys hous / whom he robbed and dyspoylled / But that holy man prayd them that robbed hym that they wold brynge hym to theyr mayster for he had to speke wyth hym in hys hows of a secrete thyng for hys prouffyt / and whan the robbers herde that / they ladde hym to fore the knyght their lord And anon the holy man prayd hym that he wold doo come all hys meyney to fore hym / And whan hys mayne by the comādement of the knyght were assembled / the holy man said / yet ben they not all here / ther is one yet to come / Thenne one of them apperceyued that the chambreleyn of the lord was not comen / And anon the knyght made hym to come / And whan the holy man sawe hym come / anon he said I coniure the by the vertue of Ihesu cryst our lord / that thou saye to vs who thou art / and for what cause thou art comen hether / Anon the chambyrleyn answerd / Alas now muste I saye & knowleche my self / I am noman / but am a deuyl whyche am in the forme of a man and haue take it xiiij yere by whyche space I haue dwellyd with this knyght / For my maystre hath sente me hether / to thende that I shold take hede nyght and day that yf this knyght cessed to saye the salutacion Aue maria For thenne I shold strangle hym with myn owen hand / and bryng hym to helle by cause of the euyl lyf that he hath ledde and ledeth / but by cause he sayeth euery day thys salutacion / Aue maria I myght not haue hym / and therfor I abode here so longe / For ther passeth hym no day but that he saleweth our lady / whan the knyght herd thys he was moche aferd / And fyl doun to the feet of thys holy man / and demāded pardon of hys synnes / After thys the holy man sayd to the deuyl / I comāde the in the name of our lord that thou departe hens / and goo in to another place / where thou mayst greue / ne annoye noman / Thenne late vs praye to the gloryouse virgyne marye / that she kepe vs fro the deuyll / And that we may by her come to the glorye of heuen To the whyche brynge vs the fader / the sone / and the holy ghoost amen / •re / & other werke to this concepcion shalt thou not doo Thus endeth the anunciacion of our blessyd Lady Here begynneth the lif of saynt Seconde knyght SAynt seconde was a noble and valyaunt knyght / and gloryous martir of our lord Ihesu cryst / And suffred hys passion and was crowned wyth the palme of martirdom in cyte of Astence / by whos gloryous presence the sayd cyte was enbelisshyd and for a synguler patron ēnoblysshid And thys holy man seconde was enformed / in the fayth of the blessyd mā Calatero whyche was holden in pryson by the prouoste Sapryce in the sayd cyte of Astence / And whan marcianus was holden in pryson in the cyte of tredonence / Sapryce the prouost wold goo thyder for to make hym do sacrefyse And saynt seconde moche desiryng to see saynt marcyane wente wyth hym / as it had ben by cause of Solace / And anone as they were out of the cyte of Altence / a whyte douue descended vpon saynt secondes heed / To whom sapryce sayd / See seconde how our goddes loue the / whyche sende byrdes fro heuē to vysite the / And whan they cam to the ryuer of tanagre saynt seconde sawe thangele of god goyng vpon the flood and sayeng to hym / Seconde see that thou haue ferme fayth / and thus shalt thou goo aboue them that worsh sayd / brother

/ Seconde byleuest thou in god / or parauenture thou doubtest / To whom seconde sayd / I byleue veryly the trouthe of hys passion / Thenne sayd Sapryce / what is that I here / And seconde sayd nothyng / whan they shold entre in to trydone / by the comādement of the angele / Marcianus yssued out of pryson and appierid to seconde sayeng / Seconde entre in to the waye of trouthe / and receyue the victorye of fayth / Sapryce sayd who is he that speketh to vs as it were in a dreme / To whom Seconde sayd / it may be wel to the a dreme / but to me it is Admonicion and a comforte / After thys seconde wente to melane / And the angele of god brought faustyn & Ionathan whyche were holden in prison out of the cyte to seconde / And of them he receyued baptesme / And a cloude mynystred water for to baptyse hym wyth / And sodenly a douue descended fro heuen bryngyng vnto faustyn and Ionatyn the blessyd sacrament / And faustyn delyuerd it to seconde for to bere it to marciane / Thenne seconde retorned whan it was nyght / & wēte to the Ryuer named pade / And the angele of our lord toke the brydle of the hors and ledde hym ouer the Ryuer / & ladde hym vnto trydone / and sette hym in the prysone where marciane was / And seconde delyuerd to marciane the yefte that faustyn had sente to hym / And receyuyng it sayd / the blessid body of our lord Ihesu cryste be wyth me in to euerlastyng lyf / ¶Thenne by the comandement of thangele / Seconde wente out of pryson and wente vnto hys lodgyng / ¶ After thys marciane receyued sentence to haue hys heed smeton of / And so it was don / And thenne seconde toke hys body and buryed it / And whan sapryce herd herof he dyde do calle seconde to hym and sayd / By thys that I see the doo / I see wel that thou art a crysten man / To whom seconde sayd / Veryly I know leche me to be a crysten man / thenne sapryce said / Loo how desirest thou to dey sayd / that deth is more due to the than to me / And whan seconde wold not sacrefyse to thydollis / he comanded to be despoylled all naked / And anon the angele of god was redy & hym cladde in a better clothyng than he had to fore Thenne Sapryce comanded hym to be hanged on an instrum̄t named eculee / of which two endes stonde on the ground and ij vpward lyke saynt Andrews crosse and theron he was honged / tyl hys Armes were out of Ioynte / but our lord restored hym anon to helthe / And thenne he was comanded to goo in to pryson / And whan he was there / thangele of our lord cam to hym and sayd / Aryse Seconde and folowe me And I shal lede the to thy maker / And he ledde hym fro thens vnto the cyte of Astence / And brought hym in to the pryson where Caleocerus was / and our blessyd saueour wyth hym / And whan seconde sawe hym / he fyl doun at hys feet / And our sauyour sayd to hym / Be not aferd seconde / For I am thy lord god that shal kepe the from all euyl / And thenne he blessyng hym ascended to heuene / On the morn Sapryce sente vnto the pryson whyche they fonde fast shette / but they fonde not second / Thenne sapryce wente fro trydone the cyte vnto Astence for to punysshe Caleocere / And whan he was come he sente for hym for to be presented to fore hym / And they said to hym that seconde was wyth hym / And anon he comanded that they shold be brought to fore hym / to whom he said By cause that my goddes knowe you to be despysers of them / they wyl that ye

and praysyng / he suffrid hys deth the thyrde kalendes of apryl / Late vs praye thenne that he praye for vs / to our lord / •ppe ydolles / Thenne Sapryce • an euyl deth To whō seconde Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Seconde martir Here begynneth the lyf of Marie Egypciaca MArye the Egypcien whyche was called a synnar / ledde and lyuyd the most strayt lyf and sharp that myght be xlvij yere in deserte / In that tyme was a good holy and relegious monke named zozimas and wente thurgh the deserte whyche lyeth by yonde the flome Iordan / And moch desired to fynde som̄e holy fadres / And whan he cam fer and depe in the deserte / he fonde a creature which was all black ouer all her body of the grete hete and brennyng of the sonne / whyche wente in that deserte / And that was thys marye egypciaca aforsaid / But assone as she sawe Zozimas come / she fledde and Zozimas after / And she taryed And sayd / Abbote Zozimas wherfore folowest thou me / haue pyte and mercy on me / For I dar not torne my face toward the by cause I am a woman & also naked / but caste thy mantel vpon me / by whyche I may thenne without shame loke and speke wyth the / And whan Zozimas herd hym self named he was gretly esmerueylled / And anon he caste to her hys mantell / And humbly prayd her that she wold gyue to hym her blessyng / And she answerd It apperteyned to the fayr fader to gyue the benediction / and nothyng to me For thou hast the dignyte of presthode / whan he herd that she knewe his name and hys offyce / he had yet more meruaylle / and of that she axid so mekely hys blessyng / After she sayd / Blessyd be god the sauyour of our sowles Thenne she lyft vp her handes vnto heuen / in makyng her prayer / And Zozimas sawe in prayeng to god her body was lyft vp fro therthe wel hye a foot and an half / And began to thynke that it had ben som̄e euyl spyryte / Thenne Zozimas coniured her by the vertue of god / that she shold telle to hym her estate / and her condicion / And she answerd / Fayr fader spare me therof / For yf I shold recoūte myn estate / ye shold flee away fro me / like as fro a venymous serpente / And thy holy eeres shold be made fowle of my wordes / And the ayer shold be ful & fowl of corrupcion / and whan she sawe that Zozimas wold not be satisfyed so / Thenne she sayd / Fayr fader I was born in Egypte / and whan I was in the age of xij yere I wente in to Alexandrye / And there I gaf my body openly to synne by the space of xvij yere / and abandouned it to lecherye and refused noman / After it happed that men of that contre / wēte for adoure and worshippe the holy crosse in Iherusalem / And I prayed to one of the maronners that he wold suffre me to passe wyth the other people the see / and whan he me demanded payement for my passage / I answerd / Fayr syres I haue nothyng to paye you wyth / but I abandonne my body to doo wyth alle your playsir for my passage / & they toke me by that condicion / & whan I was come in to Iherusalem vnto the entree of the chyrche for to worshyppe the holy crosse with the other I was sodenly & Inuysibly put a back many tymes / in suche wyse that I myght not entre in to the chirche / And thēne I retorned & thoughte in my self / that thys cam to me for the grete synnes / that I had commysed in tyme past / And began to smyte my breste and wepe tenderly and sighe greuously / And I beh there thymage of our lady / •ld And I fyl doun and prayd her all wepyng / that she wold Impetre and gete me pardon of my synnes / of her swete sone / & wold suffre me to entre in to the chyrche for to worshyppe the holy crosse / promysyng to forsake the world / And fro than forthon to lyue chaast / whan I hadde thus prayd / and to our blessyd lady thus faythfully promysid / I wente agayn to the dores of the chyrche / And wythout ony Impedyment I entred in to the chyrche / And whan I had deuoutly worshypped and adoured the holy crosse / A man gaf to me iij pens / of whyche I bought thre loues of breed And after I herd anon a voys yf thou wylt passe and goo ouer slome Iordan thou shalt be sauf / And thenne I passed Iordan and cam in to thys deserte / where I neuer saw man by the space of xvij yere / Thyse thre loues that I bare wyth me bycam hard by the drought of the tyme as a stone / of whyche I toke my sustynaunce / and suffysed to me xvij yere / And after I ete herbes / my clothes ben Roten longe syth / And thise xvij first yere I was moche tempted by the brennyng of the sonne moche asprely / And many delectacions that I haue had in mete and drynke the good wynes / and doyng the desires of my body / all thyse cam in my thought / Thenne he bewaylled them on the erthe And prayd for helpe to our blessyd lady in whom I hadde sette all my affyaunce / And I wepte moche tenderly / And anon I sawe comyng aboute me a grete light / by the whyche I was all recomforted / and loste all the thoughtes whyche ofte and greuously tempted me And sith I haue ben delyuerd of alle temptacions / and am nourisshyd of spirituel mete of the word of our lord And thus haue I be alle my lyf as I haue tolde to the / And I praye the by thyncarnacion of Ihesu criste / that thou praye for me synful creature / Thenne the olde fader Zozymas fyl doun vnto grounde / and thanked our lord god that had thus saued hys seruaunte / And she sayd I praye the fayre fader that thou wylt come ageyn on the next sherethorsday and brynge wyth the / the body of our lord for to howsel me / For sythe I entred in to thys deserte I was neuer howseled ne receyued the holy sacramente / And thēne I shal come to flomiordan ageynst the / Zozymas wente to his abbey / and after the yere passed on sherethorsday / he came ageyn in to the place / lyke as the holy woman had prayed hym / And whan he was comen to flomiordan / he sawe on that other syde the holy woman / which made the sygne of the crosse vpon the water / and wente on hit / and came ouer to hym / Whan Zozymas saw this myracle / anone he fyl doun to the feet of the holy woman / for to doo to hyr honour and reuerence / but she forbad and deffended hym and sayd / Thus oughtest thou not to doo / For thou art a preest and berest the holy sacramente the whiche she receyued in ryght grete deuocion / and sayd in wepyng / lord god please hit to the to receyue me in pees / For myn eyen hath seen my sauyour / how wel that she had alwey wept and shedde teerys so haboundauntly / that it semed that she had lost hyr sight And after she sayd to Zozymas / I praye the that at the ende of thys yere thou wylt come hyder ageyn to me / & praye for me synful creature / & anone after she made the sygne of the crosse vpon the ryuere / and passed ouer the water with drye feet / as she tofore came And Zozymas wente ageyn to hys abbey / But he repented moche that he had not demaunded the name of the woman / And after the yere passed he came ageyn to the deserte like as he had promysed to thys holy woman / And he founde hyr deed / and the body ordynatly leyed as hyt

there came a swarme of bees whiche fyl on his vysage and his mowth and after they departed and flewe vp in the eyre so hye that they myght not be seen / whan thys was doon the fader whiche was herof esmayed said yf this chylde lyue there shal be somme grete thynge of hym / After whan he was a lytel growen he behelde his moder and his suster whiche was a sacred virgyn kysse the preestes honde whan they offred / And he playeng with his suster put forthe his honde for to kysse / and sayd / that so behoued hir to do to hym And she not vnderstondyng hym refused hit / After he was sette to scole at Rome / & becam to be so good a clerke that he determyned the causes of the paleys / And therfore valentynyen the emperour delyuerd hym to gouerne two prouynces named / lygurye / and Emylye / Thenne whan he came in to melane it happed that the bysshop was deed / And the peple were assembled to prouyde for another / but bytwene the Arryens and the good cristen men for the eleccion fyl a grete sedycion & dyscorde And ambrose for to pease this sedicion wente thyder / and the voys of a chylde was herde / sayeng Ambrose oughte to be bysshop / and anone alle the people accorded therto hooly and began for to crye / Ambrose / Ambrose / But ambrose deffended as moche as he myght / and alle waye the peple cryed Ambrose / Thenne for to make the peple sece / he went out of the chyrche / and wente vp on a scaffolde and made the people to be beten ageynst the vsage & custome for to lette them that they shold name hym nomore / But yet they lefte not for al that / but the peple said thy synne be vpon vs / Thenne he beyng so troubled wente home / and suffryd comm shold reuoke theyr eleccion / but for al that / they cryed as they dyd to fore / and sayd thy synnes be vpon vs Whan saint ambrose saw that he myght not empesshe the eleccion he fled awaye but the peple awayted vpon hym / and toke hym at thyssue of the gate / and kepte hym so longe tyl they had graūte of themperour / and whan themperour knewe herof he had grete ioye / bycause that the Iuge that he had sente for the prouynces / was chosen to be theyr bysshop / And also he was glad by cause his worde was accomplisshed / for the Emperour sayd to Ambrose whan sente hym thyder / goo sayd he & abyde not there as a Iuge / but as a bysshop Saynt ambrose in the mene whyle that they abode the answere of themperour / fledde yet awaye / but he was taken ageyn / and was baptyzed / for he was not tofore baptyzed / how Wel that he was crysten in wylle / And the viij day after he was consecrate & stalled bysshop of melan / And foure yere after that he wente to Rome / and there his suster the vyrgyn kyssed his honde as of a preest / and he smylyng sayd lo as I tolde the / now thou kyssest my honde as of a preest / It happed after that whan saynt Ambrose Wente to another cytee to theleccion of a bysshop Iustyn the emperesse / and other of the secte of tharryens wold not consente to the good crysten men / But wold haue one of theyr secte / Thenne one of the vyrgyns of themperesse moche fayre toke saynt ambrose & drewe hym by his vestementes / and wold haue made hym to be beten / by cause he wold not holde the partye of the wymmen / Thenne saynt ambrose sayd to hyr yf I be not worthy to be a bysshop / yet thou oughtest not to laye honde vpon me / ne none other bysshop thou hast layed honde on me / thou oughtest moche redoubte and drede the Iugemente of god / And therfore god confermyd his sentence on hyr / For the nexte day she was born to her graue and was deed / Thus was she rewarded for the vylonye that she had done / And al the other were thereby sore aferde / After this whan he was retorned to melan / he suffred many assaultes and persecucions of the emperesse Iustyn / For she moeued by yeftes and by honoure moche people ageynste saynt ambrose / and many there were that enforced them to sende hym in exyle / And emonge al other there was one mounted in so grete madnesse and furour ageynst hym / that he hyred hym an hows by the chyrche / by cause he wold haue therin a carte for to sette saynt ambrose theron / and lede hym in to exyle / but that same fyl to hym For he hym self was sente in exyle in the same carte / the same day that he wold haue ledde aweye saynt ambrose / To whom yet saint ambrose dyd good for euyl / for he mynystred to hym hys costes & necessaryes / Saynt ambrose also establysshed in the chirche songe & offyces at melane fyrst / There were at that tyme in melane many men vexyd & bysette with deuyls which cryed with hye voys that saynt ambrose tormented them thus / but themperesse Iustyn and tharryens said / that said ambrose made them to say so for mony that he gafe to them / Thenne it happed that one of the arryens was out of his mynde & sayd thus / be they alle tormented as I am that consente not to saynt ambr drowned hym in a depe pyscyne or pytte / There was another heretyke and an arryen a sharpe and so harde that he was Inconuertyble by cause no man myght conuerte hym to the faythe / On a tyme he herde saynt ambrose preche / and he sawe at his ere an aungel that tolde hym al that he prechyd / and whan he had apperceyued this / he began to susteyn the feythe to whiche he had ben contrarye / After this it happed that one enchauntour called deuyls to hym / & sente them to saynt ambrose for to ennoye & greue hym / but the deuyls retorned and sayd that they might not approche to his yate by cause ther was a grete fyre al about his hows / and this enchauntour after Whan he was tormented of the prouost for certeyn trespaces / he cryed and said

the cytee the deuyl reentred in hym ageyn / thenne he demaunded hym why he dyd so / & he answerd by cause he was aferde of ambrose / after it happed that a man beyng conducte & hyred of Iustyn themperesse came to the beddes syde of saynt ambrose / & Wold haue put & ryuen his swerde thorugh his body / but anone his arme was dryed vp / Another was vexed With a deuyl said that saynt ambrose

For ambrose can not be so blowen and wo llen as thou arte / Thenne was he stylle and spake not / whan saynt ambrose wente in the towne / he sawe a man laughe by cause he sawe another falle / thenne said ambrose to hym thou that laughest / beware that thou falle not also / and after he fylle / and thus was he taughte that he shold not mocque his felawe / On a tyme Saynt Ambrose wente vnto the paleys for to praye for a poure man / but the Iuge made to close the gate that he myght not entre in / Thenne saint ambrose said thou shalt come for to entre in to the chyrche / but thou shalt not

the worde out of hys mowthe / but the deuyl began to tormente hym / After as it is sayd on a tyme he wente to rome & whan he was on a tyme by the waye herberowed wyth a ryche man / Saynt ambrose began to demaunde hym of his estate / that ryche man answerd / Syr myn estate is happy ynough and gloryous / For I haue rychesses ynough / seruauntes / varlettes / chyldren / neuewes / cosyns / frendes / and kynnysmen whiche serue me / and al my werkes and besoynyes come to my wylle ne I haue neuer thynge that may angre ne trowble me / Thenne sayd saynt Ambrose to them that were wyth hym Flee we hens for our lord god is not here / haste you fayre chyldren / haste you and lete vs abyde here no lengyr / leste the vengeaunce of god take vs / & that we be not wrapped in the synnes of these peple / They departed & fledde anone / but they were not goon ferre but that the erthe opened & swolowed in alle the hows of this ryche man / & there abode not as moche as the steppe of hym self ne of al that

by dyscressyon / and therfore he had wyn of gladnesse / & wythin he was playne of humylite / and therby put he forth whete of good werke / Or george may be sayd of gera that is holy / and of gyon that is a wrasteler / that is as an holy wrasteler / For he wrastled with the dragon / Or hit is sayd of George that is a pylgrym / and geyr / that is or detrenchyd out / and vs / that is a coūceyllour / He was a pylgrym in the sight of the World / and he was cutte and detrenched by the crowne of martirdom and he was a good counceyllour in prechyng / And his legende is nombred emonge other scriptures apocryfate in the counceyl of nycene / by cause his marterdom hath no certeyn relacion For in the kalender of bede it is sayd that he suffred marterdom in parsydye in the cyte of dyapolin / And in other places hit is redde that he restyth in the cyte of dyspolyn / whyche tofore was called lyde / whyche is by the cite of Ioppem or Iaph / And in another place hit is sayd that he suffred dethe vnder dyoclesian / and Maxymyan / whyche that tyme were Emperours / And in another place vnder Dioclesian / Emperour of Perse beyng presente lxx kynges of hys empyre / And it is sayd here that he suffred deth vnder dacyen the prouoste / Thenne Dioclesyan and Maxymyan beyng emperours / ¶Here foloweth the lyf of saynt George martyr SAynt George was a knyght and borne in capodose / On a tyme he came in to the prouynce of Lybye to a cyte whyche is sayd Sylene / And by this cyte was a stagne or a ponde lyke a see / wherein was a dragon whyche enuenymed alle the contre / And on a tyme the peple were assemblid for to slee hym / And whan they sawe hym they fledde / And whan he came nyghe the cytee / he venymed the peple wyth his breeth / And therfore the peple of the cytee gaue to hym euery day two sheep for to fede hym / by cause he shold doo no harme to the peple / And whan the sheep fayled there was taken a man and a sheep / Thenne was an ordenaunce made in the towne / that there shold be taken the chyldren and yonge peple of them of the towne by lotte / And eueryche as it fyl were he gentil or poure shold be delyuerd whan the lotte fyl on hym or hyr / So it happed that many of them of the towne were thenne delyuerd / In soo moche that the lotte fyl vpon the kynges doughter / Wherrof the kyng was sory and sayd vnto the people / For the loue of the goddes take golde and syluer and alle that I haue / and lete me haue my doughter / they sayd how syr ye haue made and ordeyned the lawe / and our chyldren been now deed / And now ye wold doo the contrarye / your doughter shal be gyuen / or ellys we shal brenne you & your hows whan the kyng saw he myght nomore doo he began to wepe and sayd to his doughter / Now shal I neuer see thyn espousayls / Thenne retorned he to the peple and demaūded viij dayes respyte And they graunted hit to hym / and whan the viij dayes were passed they came to hym and sayd / thou seest that the cyte perissheth / Thēne dyd the kyng doo araye his doughter / lyke as she shold be wedded / and enbraced hyr kyssed hir and gaue hir his benedyccion / And after ledde hyr to the place where the dragon was / whan she was there / saynt george passed by / And whan he sawe the lady / he demaunded the lady what she made there / And she sayd / goo ye your waye fayre yonge man / that ye perysshe not also / Thenne sayd he telle to me what haue ye / and why ye wepe / and doubte ye of no thynge / whan she sawe that he wold knowe she sayd to hym how she was delyuerd to the dragon / Thenne sayd saynt george / Fayre doughter doubte ye no thynge herof / For I shall helpe the in the name of Ihesu Cryste / She said for goddes sake good knyght goo your waye / and abyde not wyth me / for ye may not delyuer me / Thus as they spake to gyder the dragon apperyd & came rennyng to them and saynt George was vpon his hors & drewe out his swerde & garnysshed hym wyth the signe of the crosse / and rode hardely ageynst the dragon which came toward hym and smote hym with his spere and hurte hym sore & threwe hym to the grounde / And after sayd to the mayde / delyuer to me your gyrdel and bynde hit about the necke of the dragon / and be not aferde / whan she had doon soo the dragon folowed hyr as it had been a make beest and debonayr / Thenne she ledde hym in to the cyte / & the peple fledde by mountayns and valeyes / and sayd / alas / alas / we shal be alle deed / Thenne saynt George sayd to them / ne doubte ye no thynge / wythout more byleue ye in god Ihesu cryste / and doo you to be baptysed / and I shal slee the dragon / Thenne the kyng was baptysed and al his peple / and saynt george slewe the dragon and smote of his heed / And commaunded thathe shold be throwen in the feldes / and they took iiij cartes wyth oxen that drewe hym out of the cyte / ¶Thenne were there wel fystene thousand men baptised without wymmen and chyldren / And the kyng dyd doo make a chirche there of our lady and of saynt George / In the whiche yet sourdeth a founteyn of lyuyng water whiche heleth seek peple that drynke therof / After this the kyng offred to Saint george as moche money as there myght be nombred / but he refused alle and commaunded that it shold be gyuen to poure peple for goddes sake / and enioyned the kynge iiij thynges / that is / that he shold haue charge of the chyrches / and that he shold honoure the preestes / and here theyr seruyce dylygently / and that he shold haue pyte on the poure peple / And after kyssed the kyng and departed / Now hit happed that in the tyme of dyoclesyen and maxymyen whyche were Emperours / was soo grete persecucion of crysten men / that wythin a moneth were marterd wel xxij / thousand / And therfore they had soo grete drede that somme renyed and forsoke god and dyd sacrefyse to the ydolles / whan saynt george sawe thys he lefte thabbyte of a knyght / and solde alle that he had / and gaue hit to the poure / and toke thabbyte of a crysten man & went in to the mydel of the paynyms / And began to crye / al the goddes of the paynyms and gentyls been deuyls / My god made the heuens & is veray god Thēne said the prouost to hym of what presumpcion cometh thys to the / that thou sayest that our goddes ben deuyls and saye to vs what thou arte / & what is thy name / he answerd anone and sayd / I am named george / I am a gentyl man a knyght of capadoce / and haue lefte al for to serue god of heuen Thenne the prouoste enforced hym sefl to drawe hym vnto his feythe by fayre wordes / & whan he myght not brynge hym therto / he dyd doo reyse hym on a gylet / & soo moche bete hym with grete staues and broches of yron / that his body was alle to broken in pyeces / And after he dyd doo take brondes of yron and ioyne them to his sydes and his bowellys whiche thenne appyeryd he dyd doo frote wyth salte / And soo sente hym in to pryson / but our loord appyered to hym the same nyght wyth grete lyght and comforted hym moche swetely / And by this grete consolacion he took to hym soo good herte / that he doubted no tormēt that they myght make hym suffre / Thenne whan dacian the prouost sawe that he myght not surmounte hym / he called hys enchaunter and sayd to hym / I see that these cristen peple doubte not our tormentes / Thenchaūtour bonde hym self vpon his heed to be smyten of / yf he ouercome not his craftes / Thenne he dyd take stronge venym and medled hyt wyth wyne / and made Inuocacion of the names of his false goddes / and gafe hyt to Saynt George to drynke / Saynt george took hit and made the signe of the crosse on hit / and anone dranke it without greuyng hym ony thynge / Thenne the Enchaunteur made it more stronger than hit was tofore of venym and gaue it hym to drynke / And hit greuyd hym no thynge / whan the enchaunteur sawe that / he knelyd doun at the feet of saynt george / and prayed hym that he wold make hym crysten / And whan dacyen knewe that he was becomen crysten / he made to smyte of his heed / And after on the morne he made saynt George to be sette betwene two wheles whiche were ful of swerdes sharpe and cuttyng on bothe sydes But anone the wheles were broken / & Saynt george escaped wythout hurte And thenne commaunded dacian that they shold put hym in a cawdren full of molten leed / & whan saynt george entred therin / by the vertu of our lord hym semed that he was in a bayne wel at ease / Thenne dacyen seyng thys / began to aswage his yre and to flatre hym by fayre wordes / and said to hym George the pacyence of our goddes is ouer grete vnto the / whiche hast blasphemyd them / and done to them grete despyte / thenne fayre and right swete sone / I praye the that thou retorne to our lawe and make sacrefyse to the ydolles / and leue thy folye / and I shal enhaunce the to grete honour and worshyp / Thenne began saynt George to smyle and sayd to hym / wherfore saydest thou not to me thus at the begynnyng / I am redy to do as thou sayest / Thenne was dacyan gladde / and made to crye ouer alle the towne that alle the peple shold assemble for to see George make sacrefyse / which so moche had stryued there ageynst / Thenne was the cyte arayed / and feste thorugh out al the towne / and al came to the temple for to see hym / whan saynt George was on his knees / and they supposed that he wold haue worshypped thydolles / he prayed our lord god of heuen that he wold destroye the temple and thydolle in the honoure of his name / For to make the peple to be conuerted / And anone the fyre descended fro heuen and brente the temple and thydolles and theyr preestes / And sythe the erthe opened and swalowed alle the cendres and asshes that were lefte / Thenne dacien made hym to be broughte tofore hym and sayd to hym / what ben the euyl dedes that thou hast doon / and also grete vntrouthe / Thenne sayd to hym saynt george / A syr beleue it not / but come wyth me & see how I shal sacrefye / Thenne sayd dacyan to hym / I see wel thy frawde & thy barate / thou wylt make the erthe to swalowe me / lyke as thou hast the temple and my goddes / Thenne sayd saynt george / O caytyffe telle me how may thy goddes helpe the whan they may not helpe them self / Thenne was dacyan soo angry that he sayd to hys wyf / I shal deye for angre yf I may not surmounte and ouercome thys man / Thenne sayd she to hym euyl and cruel tyraunt ne seest thou not the grete vertue of the crysten peple I sayd to the wel that thou sholdest not doo to them ony harme / For theyr god fyghteth for them / And knowe thou wel that I wyl become crysten / Thenne was dacy sayd to hir wylt thou be crysten / thēne he took hir by the here / and dyd do bete hyr cruelly / Thenne demaunded she of saynt george / what may I become by cause I am not crystenyd / Thenne answerd the blessyd george / doubte the no thynge fayre doughter / For thou shalt be baptysed in thy blood / Thenne began she to worship our lord Ih̄u crist and so she deyed and wente to heuen / On the morne dacian gaue his sentēce that saynt George shold be drawen thorugh alle the citee / And after his heed shold be smyten of / Thenne made he his prayer to our lord / that alle they that desyred ony bone myght gete of our lord god in his name / and a voys cam from heuen whiche sayd / that hyt whiche he had desyred was graunted and after he had made his oryson / his heed was smyten of aboute the yere of our lord ijClxxxvij / Whan Dacyen wente homeward fro the place where he was byheded toward hys paleys / Fyre fyl doun fro heuen vpon hym / & brente hym and alle hys seruauntes Gregore of Turonense telleth that there were somme that bare certeyn relyques of saynt george / and came in to a certeyn oratorye in an hospytal / and on the mornyng whan they shold departe they coude not meue the dore tyll they had lefte there parte of their relyques It is also founden in thystorye of antyoche / that whan the cristen men went ouer see to cōquere Iherusalem / that one a right fayre yonge man appered to a preest of the hooste / & counceylled hym that he shold bere wyth hym a lytel of the reliques of saynt george / For he was conduytour of the batayle / and so he dyd so moche that he had somme / And whan hit so was that they had assyeged Iherusalem / & durst not moūte ne goo vp on the walles for the quarellys and defence of the sarasyns / they sawe appertely saint george which had whyte armes with a reed crosse that

declyned by reson of parfyte and grete humylite / For bycause of grete mekenes / he cutte of his thombe / to the ende that he shold not be chosen to be a preest / He was bytter by reson of right

cōfermed the chirche Of Saynt marke the Euangelyste MArke theuangeliste was of the kynrede of the leuytes / and was a preest / And whan he was crystened he was godsone of saynt Peter thappostle / And therfore he wente wyth hym to Rome / Whan Saynt peter preched there the gospell the good peple of Rome prayed saynt marke / that he wold put the gospell in wrytyng lyke as saynt Peter had preched / ¶ Thenne he at theyr request wrote / and shewed hit to his mayster saynt peter to examyne / And whan saynt Peter had examyned hit / and sawe that hit conteyned y e veray trouth he approuyd hit / And

sawe that he said / verayly I see that my iourney is sped / ne the deuyl may not lette me / syth that god hath assoyled me of my synnes / Thenne wente saynt marke to a shomaker for tamende his shoes / And as he shold werke he prycked & sore hurted his lyfte hande with his alle / and whan he felte hym hurte he cryed on hye one god / whan saynt marke herde that / he sayd to hym Now knowe I wel that

here foloweth of saynt Iames the lasse IAmes is as moche to say as supplantour or supplantyng a feste or makyng redy / or Iames is said of Ia & of cobar which is as moche to saye as the burthen or weyght of god / or Iames may be said of Iaculo a darte & cope smytyng / which is to say smeten with a darte / or smeten with glayues / he was said a supplantour of the world / for he despysed hit / in supplantyng the feste / for he supplanted the deuyl / & he is said makyng redy / for alweye he made redy his body to do wel / for as gregore of nycene saith / we haue in vs thre euyl passyons / whiche

exersitacion of doctryne / So thēne the blessid Iames is escryed / for he was alwey redy in his body to al good / he is sayd the burthen or weyghte of good or godly maners that he vsed by exercitacion of vertues / he was smeten wyth glayues by marterdom / ¶Of saynt Iames the lasse IAmes the appostle is said the lasse / how wel that he was elder of age than was Saynt Iames the more / by cause lyke as is in relygyon / he that entred fyrst is called ayne / and grete / & he that cometh after shal be called lasse though he be the older / and in this wyse was thys saynt Iames called the lasse / he was called also the broder of our lord / by cause he resembled moche wel our lord in body in vysage / and of manere he was called Iames the Iuste for his right grete holynesse / Far saint Iherome recordeth that he was so holy that the peple s called Iames the sone of alphey / this Iames was euer holy after that he yssued out of his moders wombe / he neuer dranke wyne / mede / ne sydre ne neuer ete flesshe / ne neuer rasour touched his heed ne he neuer baygned / he knelyd so ofte in prayers / that his knees were as harde as the horne of a camel / he sange in Iherusalem the fyrst masse that euer was songe therin / & he was fyrst bysshop of Iherusalem / Ioseph recordeth that he had auowed at the deth of our lord that he wold neuer ete tyl our lord were rysen fro deth to lyf / thēne on ester day our lord apperid to hym & said / and gaue it to hym / The seuenth yere after the appostles assembled in Ierusalem on ester day / there saynt Iames demaundyng what god had done by them tofore the peple / that they shold telle / and whan saynt Iames had preched seuen dayes in the temple with the other appostles / Cayphas and somme other wold haue ben baptyzed / And thenne entryd in a man sodeynly in to the temple and said cryeng / O ye syrres what wyl ye doo / why suffre ye thus to be dysceyued of thyse enchauntours / be ye ware & kepe you that they dysceyue you not / he moeuyd so moche the people that they wold haue stoned the appostles / Thenne thys felowe wente vp to the lectron where as saynt Iames preched and threwe hym doun bacwarde / and fro thenne forthon euer after he halted And thys was doon the vij yere after the ascencion of our lord / And he was bysshop there by the space of xxx yere And in his xxx yere whan the Iewes sawe that they myght not slee Saynt Poule / bycause he had appeled to the Emperour to Rome / and was sente forthe to Rome / they torned al theyr persecusyon ageynst saynt Iames / and sayd to hym the peple is dysceyued / for they supposed that your Ihesus were messyas / Thenne for as moche as thou arte moche byleuyd / we praye the that thou assemble the peple / and that thou stonde vp on hye / and shewe to them that it is not he / For thou arte so iuste that We alle shal byleue in the / Thenne saynt Iames wente vp on the fronte of the temple on ester day / and alle the peple were assembled bynethe Thenne sayde the Iewes to hym wyth an hye voys / Right Iuste & trewe man we knowe wel that thou shalt not lye Shewe to vs of Ihesus that was hanged vpon the crosse that whiche thou knowest / for al the world is dysceyued / Thenne answerd he with an hye voys / wherfore demaunde ye me of the sone of the vyrgyn / I say to you that he is now in heuen and sytteth on the ryght syde of god the fader / and shall come deme the lyuyng and the deed / whan the crysten men had herde hym / they were moche glad / But the pharysees and the maysters of the lawe repented them of thys / that they had made hym to say and bere this witnesse tofore the people / And toke counceyll to gydre / for to caste hym doun / for to make the people aferde / by cause they shold not byleue hym / and they cryed O the Iuste man hath erryd at thys tyme / and after they threwe hym doun and the peple began to stone hym / but he was on his knees and sayd / Fayre lord god pardone them / for they wote not what they doo / Thenne escryed one of the sonnes of the preest named Iacob / Syres leue ye this iuste man in pees / but there was a man in that companye toke a fullers staffe / and smote hym on the heed / that his brayne fyl alle abrode / And thus by marterdom he fynysshed his lyf / and was there buryed nygh vnto the temple / And the peple wold haue slayne these malefactours / bycause they had sleyne hym / but they fledde / this was done in the tyme of nero the yere of our lord lvij / ¶ Iosephus sayth that for thy grete synne of the deth of saynt Iames / Was Ierusalem afterward destroyeed / For tofore that the destruccion came / god shewed meruayllous signes / For there was a sterre right clere and shynyng / whiche had the fourme of a swerde that henge ouer Ierusalem but this token ne the tokenes hereafter folowyng / cam not onely for the deth of saynt Iames / but for the dethe of our lord Ihesu crist pryncypally / for he said ther shal not in the be left a stone vpon a stone / but bycause our lord wold not the dethe of synnars / but that he wold they shold doo penaunce and repente them / he abode fourty yere / and called them vnto penaunce by his appostles / and moste by saynt Iames broder of our lord / whiche contynuelly prechyd to them / For in thys fourty yere were many signes and prodyges shewed to them as Iosephus reherceth of which the sterre lyke the swerde was one Whiche was seen ouer the cyte an

day / In that same tyme there was a cowe brought forth to be sacrefyed / whyche anone calued or brought forth a lambe ageynst kynde / After this a litel tyme aboute goyng doun of the sonne there was seen in the eyre cartes & waynes and grete companye of men of armes that enuyronned the cytee sodaynly / In a feste of whytsontyde whyche is called penthecoste / the preestes wente in to the temple by nyght / for to doo theyr mysteryes / and they herde a voys sayeng / lete vs goo hens fro this place & iiij yere after tofore that the destruccion came / a man whos name was Ihesus the sone of ananye began to crye sodeynlye / the voys of thorryent / the voys of thoccident / the voys of foure wyndes vpon Iherusalem / woo on the husbondes / woo vpon the wyues / and woo vpon alle the people / the said man was taken smeten and beten / tormented / & broughte tofore the Iuge / and he neuer wepte ne cryed mercy / but he euer perseueryd and cryed howlyng the same wordes addyng therto / woo / woo to Iherusalem / al thys sayth Iosephus / & yet for al these tokenes warnynges & prodygis / the Iewes were neuer aferde Thēne xl yere after the passyon of our lord Ihesu cryste came titus and vaspasyanus ageynst Iherusalem & destroyed hit / The cause and by whome it was destroyed is recorded in an hystorye though hit be not autentyke / For pylate which doubted the furour & angre of themperour Tybere / bycause he had wrongfully Iuged and condempned Ihesu cryste thynnocent / sente one of his seruauntes for to excuse hym / and the seruauntes name was albane / In thys tyme vaspasyanus was gouernour of galace for themperour / And the messager of pylate whyche wolde haue gone to Rome was constrayned by a contrarye wynde to arryue in galace and was broughte to vaspasyan / For the custome of the contree was that who was taken on the see / and brought so in ageynst his wylle / shold be atte wylle of the lord body & goodes And whan vaspasyanus sawe hym he demaunded hym what he was / and fro whens he came / he sayd that he was of Iherusalem / Thenne said vaspasyan A lord god in that contre were wonte to be good maysters and moche good surgyens / my frende sayd he canst thou ony thynge of surgerye / This sayd he bycause he had in his nose a botche ful of wormes fro his yongthe / and neuer myght man be founden that myght hele hym of it / the messanger of pylate answerd & said / that he coude no thynge therof / Vaspasyan sayd yf thou hele me not I shal slee the / The messanger sayd he that enlumyned the blynde and chaced deuyls out of men / And reysed deed men to lyfe in our contree knoweth wel that I can not hele the / but he can wel hele the yf he wyl / Thenne demaunded vaspasyan what he was / he sayd to hym that it was Ihesus of nazareth / whome they of Iherusalem had sleyne wrongfully for enuye / and yf thou wylt beleue in hym he shal hele the / Thenne sayd vaspasyanus / I beleue wel that he that reysed deed men may wel hele and make me al hole / & sayeng thyse wordes the waspys fyll from his nose wyth the botche wythin whyche they were / and forthwith he was made parfytely hole / wherof he had moche grete ioye / And sayd I am certeyn that he that hath thus made me hole was the veray sone of god / I shal demaunde lycence of the emperour Tybere and I shal goo destroye the cursyd traytours / that haue sleyne thys man / And thenne he lete Alban the messager of pylate goo where he wold After thys vaspasyan wente to Rome and gate lycence of themperour for to destroye thys peple and the cyte of Ierusalem / And assembled his hoost in the tyme of nero themperour / and came sodaynly / The Iewes thenne beyng the moste parte in Iherusalem on ester day and byseged the towne / For on that day al the Iewes of the contre were comen to the feest / so that they were sodaynly enclosed / Now was it soo that tofore that vaspasyan came / the good men of the cyte were warned by the holy gooste / that they shold goo out of the cytee / And they wente to a place called pellam / bycause that the vengeaunce shold not falle on them / but on the wycked peple of the Iewes / There was another cyte of the Iurye named Ionaparam / In whiche Iosephus was duc / whiche vaspasyan first assayled / but Iosephus with suche men as he had resysted them manlye / but at the laste whan Iosephus sawe the destruccion of it and myght no lenger kepe hit / he toke wyth hym twelue Iewes / and hyd hym in a caue or an hows vnder therthe / where they were foure dayes wythout mete and drynke in grete anguysshe and affliccion / Thēne the Iewes beyng there without consente of Iosephus had leuer deye / than be subgette or put them self in seruytude to vaspasyan / And wold slee them self / and offre theyr blood in sacrefyse to god / And bycause Iosephus was the moste worthy and noble of them / they wold slee hym fyrst / by whos blood god myght best be plesed or ellys as it is sayd in the cronycle that eche of them shold slee other / rather than they shold come in to the handes of the romayns / Thenne Iosephus a prudent man / and not wyllyng to deye / constytuted and ordeyned hym self Iuge of the dethe & sacrefyse / and who that fyrst shold be slayne / he ordeyned that bytwene two and two / shold be drawen lotte / and so the lotte gyuen now one was sleyne now another / tyl at the laste al were dede saufe Iosephus and one other / Thenne Iosephus beyng a stronge man and a lyghte caughte the swerde to hym / and axed his felowe whether he had leuer lyue or deye / and commaunded hym shortely wythout delaye to telle hym / and he sore dredyng sayd I forsake not to lyue yf I may by thy grace gete and kepe my lyf / Thenne Iosephus spake to a seruaunt of vospasyan and dyd so moche that he gate his lyf of vaspasian / and thenne he was broughte to vaspasyan / and Vaspasyan sayd to hym / Thou sholdest haue deyed / yf thou haddest not goten grace by the prayer and request of this man and Iosephus answerd yf ony thynge be done amys / it may torne to better / And vaspasyan sayd who that is boūden / what may he do / Iosephus āswerd somwhat may I do yf thou wylt gyue me audyence / Vaspasyan sayd I wyl wel that thou say / & yf thou say ony good / thou shalt be pesybly herde / And Iosephus sayd the Emperour of rome is dede / and the senate hath made the emperour / and vaspasian answerd yf thou be a prophete why hast thou not prophecyed to the people of thys cytee that they shal be taken by my honde / And Iosephus sayd I haue wel xl dayes warned them / and in the mene whyle came the messagers fro rome / & affermed that vaspasyen was made emperour / and ladde hym to Rome / Alle thys recounteth Eusebyus in hys cronycle / Iosephus sayd tofore to vaspasyan as wel of the dethe of themperour / as of his eleccion to be emperour And vaspasyan lefte his sone Tytus at the syege of Iherusalem / It is redde also in the same hystorye though it be apocrypha that whan Tytus herde that his fader was enhaunced in to the empyre / he was so glad and had so moche ioye / that alle hys syne wes were shronken / and was so feble that he was sore tormented wyth the palsye / and Iosephus heryng therof dylygently enquyred the cause of the sekenesse / the tyme therof / and the manere / the cause ne the sekenes were not knowen / but the tyme was whan he herde of theleccion of his fader to the empyre / Iosephus a wyse & a prudent man consyderyd the tyme of the commyng of the sekenesse / and coniected that it came of ouermoche ioye and haboundyng gladnesse / & remembryng that contraryes ben cured by theyr contraryes / For that whiche cometh of loue / is cured by hate oftymes / And began tenquyre yf there were ony man that the prynce hated moche / And it was that he had a seruaunte whome he helde in pryson / and hated hym so moche that in no wyse he myght loke on hym ne here hym named / Thenne he sayd tyto yf thou desyre to be hole / who that euer come in my felawshyp / must be here sure and saufe / Thenne Iosephus made the dyner to be redy / and sette hym self ageynst hym and the seruaunte that tytus moste hated satte on his ryght syde / whome assone as tytus had beholden he began to chauffe and to be meruaylous angry for anguysshe / Thenne he whiche was Infrigydate and colde for ioye / stratched out his synewes and was made al hole by the brennyng hete of angre and was al hole / Alle thys forsaid of Iosephus I remytte hit to the redars Iugement whether he wyl byleue it or not / but tytus laye at the syege two yere tofore the cyte and so longe that the famyne oppressyd so sore / that the faders fro the chyldren / and the chyldren fro the faders / and husbondes fro the wyues / and wyues fro the husbondes plucked the mete out of others mowthes / And yonge men that had ben ryght stronge fyl doun dede in the stretes and wayes / they that shold burye the dede fyl doun oftymes deed vpon them that Were dede / and bycause they were not borne aweye / nor they myght not suffre the stenche of the deed bodyes / they ordeyned that the comyns of the towne shold caste them ouer the walles in to the dyches / by cause they myght not endure the stenche to burye them / And whan tytus which wente aboute the cytee sawe the dyches so ful of carryens whiche corrupted alle the contree wyth the stenche / he helde vp his houdes to heuen Wepyng and sayd lord god now see I wel / that thys is not by me / but by the whiche herein takest vengeaunce / For thenne they of the towne within had so grete defaulte that they ete theyr shoys and lachettis There was a gentyl woman in the towne whiche had a chylde to whome she gaue sowke / And for hungre that she had she strangled and slewe thys chylde / and rosted that one halfe / and kepte that other for to ete / It happed that the gouernours of the towne whiche wente to serche / smellyd the sauour of thys rooste / and brake vp the dore / and thretened to slee the woman yf she gaue to them not of her mete / Thenne she shewed to them that other dele of her chylde that she had kepte / and sayd yf he wyl / I shal gladly gyue you parte / Thenne had they so grete horrour therof / that they myght not speke / Thenne sayd she thys was my sone / the synne is myn and cometh on me / ete on hardelye / for I haue eten parte tofore / for ye loued hym not soo wel as I dyd that was his moder / & yf pyte meue you that ye leue to ete of hym / I that haue eten that one halfe / knowe ye for certeyn that I shal wel ete that other halfe / They thenne beyng abhorred of thys inhumanyte wente theyr waye / After thys thenne whan vaspasyan had been emperour two yere / Tytus took Iherusalem and destroyed al / & the temple also / And lyke as the Iewes had boughte our lord for xxx pens / So gaue he thyrty Iewes for one peny / And lyke as Iosephus recordeth / He solde so foure score and xvij thousand / And xj hondred thousand were perisshed by famyne and by swerde / It is redde that whan tytus entred Iherusalem he sawe a thycke walle / whyche he dyd doo perysshe and breke And whan an hole was made therin / they sawe there a fayre olde man / hore and venerable of chere / whome they demaunded longe what he was / At the laste he answerd and sayd he was Ioseph of abyramathya a cytre of Iudee and that the Iewes had mured hym therin / by cause he had buryed cryste / and sayeng more that fro that tyme vntyl thys now / I haue ben fedde with heuenly breed and drynke / and comforted wyth deuyne lyght / Neuerthelesse in the gospel of nychodemus it is sayd / that whan the Iewes had shette hym vp / ¶ Cryste in his resurrexyon toke hym thens and ledde hym in to arymathye / It may wel be after / whan he cessyd not to preche of Cryste that the Iewes so mured hym vp / After thys whan vaspasyanus was deed / Titus his sone was made emperour after hym / and was so debonayr so lyberalle / and of soo grete bountee / that there had none be lyke hym / For as Ierome sayth / that day that he had not gyuen a yefte / ne had done no good at euyn he sayd to his frendes / O my frendes thys day haue I loste / After this / longe tyme it happed that somme Iewes wold reedefye Iherusalem / and on the fyrst mornynge that they wente to werke / they founde crosses on the dewe / and thenne they fledde / And after they came ageyn and began to reedefye ageyn / And thenne they founde blody crosses / And thenne they fledde aweye ageyn / And the thyrd tyme they came ageyn and out of the erthe yssued a fyre and brente & wasted them alle / ¶Thus endeth the lyf of Saynt Iames the lasse with the storye of Iosephus and the destruction of Iherusalem / ¶ Of thynuencion of tholy crosse / and first of thys worde Inuencion THe Inuencion of the holy crosse is said bycause that this day the holy crosse was founden / for tofore it was founden of seth in paradyse terrestre / lyke as hit shal be sayd here after / and also it was founden of salamon in the moute of lybane and of the quene of saba / in the temple of salamon / And of the Iewes in the water of pyscyne / And on thys day it Was founden of Helayne in the mounte of caluarye / Of the holy crosse THe holy crosse was foūden two hondred yere after the resurrexyon of our lord / It is redde in the gospel of nychodemus / that wh Wexyd seek / Seth his sone Wente to the yate of paradise terrestre for to gete the oyle of mercy for to enoynte wyth al his faders body / Thenne apperid to hym saynt mychel thaungel & sayd to hym / traueyle not the in vayne / for this oyle / for thou mayst not haue it tyl fyue thousand and fyue hondred yere been passed / how be it that fro Adam vnto the passyon of our lord were but fyue MC and xxxiij yere / In another place it is redde that the aungel broughte hym a braunche / and commaunded hym to plante it in the mounte of lybanye / Yet fynde we in another place / that he gafe to hym of the tree that Adam etc of / And sayd to hym that whan that bare fruyte he shold be guarysshed and alle hoole / Whan seth came ageyn he founde his fader deed / & planted this tree vpon his graue / And it endured there vnto the tyme of Salamon / and by cause he sawe that it was fayre he dyd doo hewe it doun / and sette it in his hows named saltus / and whan the quene of saba came to vysyte Salamon / She worshypped this tree by cause she sayd the sauyour of alle the world shold be hanged theron / by whome the royame of the Iewes shal be defaced and seace Salamon for this cause made hit to be taken vp / & doluen depe in the grounde Now it happed after that they of Ierusalem / dyd do make a grete pytte for a pyscyne / where as the mynystters of the temple shold Wesshe theyr bestys / that they shold sacrefyse / & there foūde thys tree / and thys pyscyne had suche vertue / that the aungels descended and meuyd the water / and the first seek man that descendyd in to the water after the meuyng / was made hole of what someuer sekenesse he was seek of And whan the tyme approched of the passyon of our lord / thys tree aroos out of the water and floted aboue the water / And of this pyece of tymbre made the Iewes the crosse of our lord / Thenne after this hystorye / the crosse by whiche we been saued / came of the tree by whiche we were dampned / And the water of that pyscyne had not his vertue onely of the aungel / but of the tre / Wyth this tre wherof the crosse was maad / there was a tree that wente ouerthwarte / on whiche the armes of our lord were nayled / And another pyece aboue whiche was the table / wherin the tytle was wryten / and another pyece wherein the sokette or morteys was maad that the body of the crosse stood in / soo that there were foure manere of trees / That is of palme of cypres / of cedre and of olyue / So eche of thyse foure pyeces was of one of these trees / This blessyd crosse was put in the erthe and hyd by the space of an hondred yere and more / But the moder of themperour whyche was named helayne fonde it in thys manere / For Constantyn came wyth a grete multitude of barbaryns nyghe vnto the ryuer of the dunoe / whyche wold haue goon ouer for to haue destroyed alle the contre / And whan constantyn had assembled his hoost / He wente and sette them ageynst that other partye / but assone as he began to passe the ryuer / he was moche aferde / by cause he shold on the morne haue batayle / and in the nyght as he slepte in his bedde / an aungel awoke hym / and shewed to hym the sygne of the crosse in heuen and sayd to hym / Beholde on hye on heuen / Thenne sawe he the crosse made of ryght clere lyght / & was wryten there vpon wyth lettres of golde / In this sygne thou shalte ouercome the bataylle / Thenne was he alle comforted of thys vysyon / And on the morne / he put in his banere the crosse / and made it to be borne tofore hym and his hoost / and after smote in the hoost of his enemyes / and slewe and chaced grete plente / After thys he dyd doo calle the bysshoppes of the ydolles / and demaunded them to what god the signe of the crosse apperteyned And whan they coude not answere / some crysten men that were there told to hym the mysterye of the crosse / and enformed hym in the faythe of the trynyte / Thenne anone he byleued parfytely in god / and dyd do baptyse hym and after it happed that constantyn his sone remembred the vyctorye of his fader / Sente to helayn his moder for to fynde the holy crosse / Thenne helayne wente in to Iherusalem / and dyd doo assemble alle the wyse men of the contre / and whan they were assembled / they wold fayn knowe wherfore they were called / Thenne one Iudas sayd to them / I wote wel that she wyl knowe of vs where the crosse of Ihesu cryste was leyed / but beware you al / that none of you telle hyr / For I wote wel thenne shal our lawe be destroyed / For zacheus myn olde fader sayd to symon my fader / And my fader sayd to me at his dethe / worshypped the crosse shall thenne reygne / And verayly this Ihesus was the sone of god / • adam •e wel ware / that for no tormente that ye may suffre / telle not where the crosse of Ihesu criste was leyde / For after that hit shal be founden / the Iewes shal reygne nomore / but the crysten men that Thenne demaunded I my fader / wherfore had they hanged hym on the crosse sythe it was knowen that he was the sone of god / thenne he sayd to me fayre sone I neuer accorded therto / But gayn said it al were / but the pharisees dyd it bycause he repreuyd theyr vyces / but he aroos on the thyrd day / and his dysciples seeyng he ascended in to heuen / Thenne by cause that stephen thy broder byleued in hym / the Iewes stoned hym to dethe / Thenne when Iudas had sayd thyse wordes to his felawes / they answerd we neuer herde of suche thynges / neuerthelesse kepe the wel yf the auene demaunde the therof / that thou say nothynge to hyr / whan the auene had called them / and demaunded them the place where our lord Ihesu cryste had be crucefyed / they wold neuer telle ne ensygne hyr / Thenne commaunded she to brenne them alle / but thenne they doubted and were aferde / & delyuerd Iudas to hyr and sayd / lady thys man is the sone of a prophete and of a Iuste man / and knoweth right wel the lawe / & can telle to you al thynge that ye shal demaunde hym / Thenne the quene lete al the other goo and reteyned Iudas wythout moo / Thenne she shewed to hym his lyfe & dethe & bad hym chese whyche he wold Shewe to me sayd she the place named golgata where our lord was crucefyed by cause / and to the ende that we may fynde the crosse / ¶ Thenne sayd Iudas it is two hondred yere passed & more / & I was not thenne yet borne Thenne sayd to hym the lady / by hym that was crucyfyed / I shal make the perisshe for hungre / yf thou

after whan he was sacred in to the papacye / he remembryd the royame of englond / and sente saynt Austyn as heed and chyef / & other holy monkes & preestes with hym to the nombre of xl persones vnto the royame of englond / & as they came toward englond they came in the prouynce of Andegauence / purposyng to haue restyd alle nyght at a place called pounte Say a myle fro the cyte and ryuer of ligerym but the wymmen scorned and were so noyous to them that they droof theym out of the towne / and they came vnto a fayre brode elme / and purposyd to haue restyd there that nyght / but one of the wymmen which was more cruel than the other purposed to dryue them thens / & came so nyghe them that they myght not reste there that nyght / And thenne Saynt Austyn toke hys staffe for to remeue fro that place / and sodeynly his staffe sprange out of hys honde with a grete vyolence the space of thre furlonges thens and there styked faste in the erthe / and whan saynt austyn came to his staffe and pulled hit out of the erthe / in contynente by the myght of our lord sourded & sprange there a fayre welle or fontayn of clere water / whiche refresshyd hym wel and al his felawshyp / & aboute that welle they restyd alle that nyght / and they that dwellyd there by / sawe alle that nyght ouer that place a grete lyght comyng fro heuen which couerd all that place where these holy men laye / And on the morne saynt austyn wrote in therthe with his staffe besyde the welle these wordes folowyng / here had austyn the seruaunte of the seruauntes of god hospytalite / whome saynt gregory the pope hath sente to conuerte englond / On the morne whan the holy men / the dwellers of the coostes therby / whyche sawe the lyght in the nyʒt tofore / came thyder and fonde there a fayre welle / of the whiche they merueyled gretely / And whan they sawe the scrypture wreton in the erthe / thenne they were gretely abasshed by cause of theyr vnkyndenesse / and repented them ful sore of that they had mocked them the day before / and after they edefyed there a fayre chyrche in the same place / in the worshyp of saynt austyn / the whyche the bysshop of andegaueuse halowed And to the halowyng therof came soo grete multitude of peple that they trad the corne in the feldes doun al playne lyke vnto a flore clene swepte / For there was no sparyng of hit / Not wythstondyng at the tyme of repyng that

welle / and yet vnto this day may no woman come in to that chyrche / but there was a noble woman that sayd that she was not gylty in offendyng saynt Austyn / and toke a tapre in hir honde and went for to offre hit in the said chyrche / but the sentence of almyghty god may not be reuoked / for as soone as she entryd the chyrche hir bowellys and synowes began to shrynke and she fyl doun dede in

arryued in the yle of thanet in este kente / and kyng athelberte regned that tyme in kente / which was a noble man and a myghty / To whome saynt austyn sente shewyng the entente of hys comyng from the

of heuen / & shold regne with almyghty god in his kyngdom / And thenne kynge adelston heeryng this / cōmaūded that they shold abyde and tarye in the same yle / And that / al thynges shold be mynystred to them that were necessarye vnto the tyme that he were otherwyse aduysed / And sone after the kynge came to them in the same yle / and he beyng in the felde saynt austyn with his felowshyp came and spake with hym hauyng tofore them the sygne of the crosse syngyng by the weye the letanye besechyng god deuoutely to strengthe them and helpe and the kyng receyued hym and hys felawshyp / & in the same place saynt austyn preched a glorious sermone / & declared there to the kynge the crysten feythe openlye and the grete meryte & auayle that shold come therof in tyme comyng / and whan he had ended hys sermon / the kyng sayd to hym your promyses ben ful fayre that ye brynge but by cause they be newe & haue not ben herde here before / we may not yet gyue consente therto / Neuerthelesse by ceuse ye be come as pylgryms fro ferre contres / we wyl not be greuous ne harde to you / but we wyl receyue you mekely / & mynystre to you suche thynges as ben necessarye / neyther we wyl forbede you / but as many as ye can conuerte to your feythe and relygyon by your prechyng ye shal haue lycence to baptyse them / and to accompanye them to your lawe / And thenne the kynge gaue to them a mancion in the cyte of dorobernence / whiche now is called caunterburye / And whan they drewe nye the cyte / they came in wyth a crosse of syluer and with processyon syngyng the letanye / prayeng almyghty god of socour & helpe / that he wold take aweye his wrathe fro the cytee / and tenflawme the hertes of the peple to receyue hys doctryne / And thenne saynt austyn and hys felawshyp began to preche there the word of god / & aboute there in the prouynce and suche peple as were wel dyspysed anon were conuerted and folowed this holy man / and by the holy conuersacion and myracles that they dyd / moche p And whan it came to his ere / anone he came to the presence of saint austyn / & desyred hym to preche ageyn / and thenne the word of god soo enflamed hym that Incontynente assone as the sermone was ended the k erryd so longe / and knowe not of hym that thou spekest of / Thy promesses ben so delectable that I thynke it alle to longe tyl I be crystened / wherfore holy fader I requyre the to mynystre to me the sacramente of baptesme / And thenne saynt austyn seyng the grete mekenesse and obedyence of the kynge that he had to be crystened / he toke hym vp wi baptysed hym wyh alle his howsholde & meyne / & enfor and gladnesse / and whan alle thys was doon / saynt austyn desyryng the helthe of the peple of englond / wente forthe on fote to yorke / and whan he came nyghe the cyte / there mette wyth hym a blynde man / which sayd to hym / O thou holy austyn / helpe me that am ful nedy / To whome saynt austyn sayd I haue no syluer / but suche as I haue I gyue the / In the name of Ih̄u cryste aryse and be alle hole / and with that worde he receyued his syght / and bylonyd in our lorde and was baptysed / And vpon crystemas day he baptysed in the ryuer named swale x thousand men wythout wymmen and chyldren And there was a grete multitude of peple resortyng to the sayd ryuer / whiche was so depe that no man myght passe ouer on foot / and yet by myracle of our lord there was neyther man woman ne chylde drowned / But they that were seek were maad ho ole bothe in body and in sowle / and in the same place / they bylded a chyrche in the worshyp of god and saynt austyn / And whan Saynt Austyn had preched the feythe to the peple / and bad confermed them stedfastly therin / he retorned ageyn fro yorke / and by the weye he mette a lepre askyng helpe / and whan saynt austyn had sayd these wordes to hym / In the name of Ihesu Cryste be thou clensyd from al thy lepre / Anone alle hys fylthe fyl aweye / and a fayre newe skyn apperyd on hys body so that he semed alle a newe man / Also as Saynt Austyn came in to oxford shyre to a towne that is called com wa of me to paye his tythes to •ned god / and yet he wythholdeth them / & therfore I haue cursed hym / & I fynde hym the more obstynate / To whome saynt austyn sayd / sone why payest thou not thy tythes to god and to the chyrche / knowest thou not that the tythes be not thyn but bylongen to god / And thenne the knyght sayd to hym I knowe wel that I tyle the grounde wherfore I ought as wel to haue the tenthe sheef as the ix / and whan saynt austyn coude not torne the knyghtes entente / thenne he departed from hym and wente to masse / & or he began / he charged that al they that there were acursed shold goo out of the chyrche / & thenne roos a dede body & wente out in to the chircheyerde with a whyte clothe on his heed / & stood styl there tyl the masse were doon / And thenne saynt austyn wente to hym and demaunded hym what he was / and he answerd and said I was somtyme lord of thys towne / & bycause I wold not paye my tythes to my curate / he acursed me and so I deyed and wente to helle / and thenne saynt austyn bad hym brynge hym to the place where his curate was buryed / And thenne the caryon broughte hym thyder to the graue / & by cause that al men shold knowe that lyf and deth ben in the power of god / saynt austyn said I commaūde the in the name of god to aryse / for we haue nede of

ye / wold god that I had neuer knowen hym / for he was a wythholder of hys tythes and in al his lyf an euyl doar / thou knowest that our lord is mercyful / and as longe as the paynes of he lle endure lete vs also be mercyful to al crysten / and thenne saynt austyn delyuerd to the curate a rodde / and there the knyght knelyng on his knees was assoyled / and thenne he commaunded hym to goo ageyn to his graue / and there to abyde tyl the day of dome / and he entryd anone in to his graue and forthwyth fyl to asshys and pouldre / And thenne saynt austyn sayd to the preest how longe hast thou layen here / & he sayd an hondred & fyfty yere / and thenne he askyd how it stood with hym and he said wel holy fader for I am in euerlastyng blysse / and thenne sayd saynt austyn / wylt thou that I praye to almyghty god that thou abyde here wyth vs to conferme the hertes of men in veray beleue / and thenne he said nay holy fader / for I am in a place of reste and thenne sayd saynt Austyn goo in pees / and praye for me and for al holy chyrche / and he thenne entred ageyn in to his graue / and anone the body was torned in to erthe / •ople were conuerted and grete fame aroos in the contre / •nge fyl doun to the feet of Saynt austyn and sayd soroufully / alas woo is me that I haue •h wepyng teerys / and ••d them dyligently in the cristen ••ythe with grete ioye •on to preche the worde of god / To whome the curate sayd / holy fader the lord of thys lordshyp hath ben oftymes Of this syght the lord was sore aferde and came al quakyng to saynt austyn and to his curate and demaunded foryeuenes of his trespaas / and promysed to make amendes / and euer after to paye his tythes / and to folowe the doctryne of saynt austyn / After this saynt austyn entryd in to dorsetshyre / and came in to a towne where as were wycked peple & refused his doctryne and prechyng vtterly & droof hym out of the towne castyng on hym the tayles of thornback or like fisshes / wherfore he besought almyghty god to shewe his Iugement on them / and god sente to them a shameful token / For the chyldren that were borne after in that place had tayles as it is sayd / tyl they had repented them / It is sayd comynly that thys fyl at strode in kente / but blessyd be god at this day is no suche deformyte / Item in another place there were certeyn people whiche wold in no wyse gyue feyth to his prechyng ne hys doctryne / but scorned and mocqued hym wherfore god toke suche vengeaūce that they brennyd with fyre Inuys reed as blood & suffred so grete payne / that they were constrayned to come and axe foryeuenes of saynt austyn / and thēne he prayed god for them that they myght be acceptable to hym and receyue baptesme and that he wold relece theyr payne / and thenne he crystened them / & that brennyng hete was quenchyd / and they were made parfytely hool / and fe •ble soo that theyr skyn was ••e neuer after more therof / On a tyme as Saynt austyn was in his prayers / our lord apperyd to hym and comfortyng hym wyth a gentyl & famylyer speche sayd / O thou my good seruaunt and trewe be thou comforted and doo manly / For I thy lord god am with the in al thyn affeccion / and myn eerys ben open to thy prayers / & for whome thou demaundest ony petycion / thou shalt haue thy desyre / And the yate of euerlastyng lyf is open to the / where thou shalt ioye with me without ende / and in that same place / where our lord sayd these wordes he fyxed his staffe in to the grounde / and a welle of clere water sourded & sprange vp in that same place / the whiche welle is called cerne / and it is in the contre of dorsete / where as now is bylded a fayre abbey and is named cerne after the welle / And the chyrche is bylded in the same place where as our lord apperyd to saynt austyn / Also in the same contre was a yonge man that was lame dombe and deef and by the prayers of saynt austyn he was made hole / and thenne sone after he was dyssolute and wanton / and noyed and greuyd the peple wyth iangelyng and talkyng in the chyrche / And thenne god sente to hym his olde Infyrmyte ageyn by cause of his mysguydyng / and atte laste he fyll to repentaunce / and asked god foryeuenes and saynt austyn / and Saynt austyn prayed for hym / and he was made hole ageyn the second tyme / and after that he contynued in good and vertuous lyuyng to his lyues eyde / And after this Saynt Austyn ful of vertues departed out of thys world vnto our lord god / and lyeth buryed at caunterbu rye in the abbay that he founded there in the worshyp & rewle Where as our lord god sheweth yet dayly many myracles / and the thyrd day before the natyuyte of our lady is halowed the translacion of saynt austyn / In whiche nyght a cytezeyn of caunterburye beyng that tyme at wynchestre saw heuen open ouer the chirche of saynt austyn / and a brennyng laddre shynyg ful bryght / and aungels comyng doun to the same chyrche / And thenne hym thought that the chirche had brennyd of the grete lyght and bryghtnes that came doun on the laddre / and merua gretely what this shold mene / For he knewe no thynge of the translacion of saynt austyn / and whan he knewe the trouthe that on that tyme the body of the glorious saynt was •led translated / he yaue lawde and thankynges to almyghty god / and we may verayly knowe by that euydent vysyon that it is an holy and a deuoute place / and as it is sayd that of olde tyme auncyent holy men that vsed to come thyder / wold at the entre of it do of theyr hosen and sho on and durst not presume to goo in to that holy monasterye but barefoot / by cause so many holy sayntes ben there shryned and buryed / and god hath shewed so many myracles in that holy place for his blessyd saynt / saynt Austyn / that yf I shold al wryte them here / it shold ocupye a grete book / Thēne lete vs praye vnto saynt austyn fader & appostle of englond by whome this londe was conuerted vnto the cresten feythe / And by hys ordenaunce bysshoppes were ordeyned to mynystre the sacramentes / that he be moyen vnto our lord Ihesu cryste / that we may here so lyue accordyng to his doctryne that after this lyf we may come to euerlastyng blysse in heuen amen / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Austyn thappostle of englond Here nexte foloweth the lyf of Saynt Germayn and first the inrtepretacion of his name gErmayn is said of germe and of ana that is hye / that is that there was founden in the seed of germayn thre souerayn thynges / that is hete natu seed / Germayn is sayd seed bourgenyng / for he had in hym hete by ardour of grete dyleccion / humour by eygrenes of deuocion / and seed by vertu

Ancerre / ¶Of Saynt germayn SAynt Germayn was of moche noble lygnage born in the cyte of ancerre / & was wel lerned in the artes lyberalle / and after he wente to rome for to lerne the scyence of droyt and of the lawe / and there receyued he so moche dygnyte / that the senate sente hym to the frensshe men for to haue the rule and dygnyte of burgoyn / and thus gouerned the cyte of ancerre more dylygently than the other / there was in the myddle of the cyte a tree callyd a pynaple tree on which were hanged on y e braūches of this tree / for the mernayle of chace and huntyng / the heedes of

ony manere / and on a tyme whan germayn was not in the cyte / the bysshop dyd do hewe doun this tree / and dyd do brenne hit / And whan Germayn knewe hit he was moche angry and forgate crysten relygyon and came with a grete multitude of knyʒtes for to haue sleyne the bysshop / •s he And thenne the bisshop knewe by reuelacion deuyne / that Saynt Germayn shold be his successour / and forbare and yaue place to his hastynes / and wente to saynt austyn / & after whan he came ageyn to ancerre / he enclosed moche subtylly germayn wythin the chyrche / and sacred hym there / and sayd to hym that he shold be his successour in the bysshop ryche / and so he was / for a lytel after saynt amadour deyed / and al the peple requyred saynt germayn to be bysshop and thenne he gaue al his rychessys to poure peple / and chaunged hys wyf in to his suster / and tormented his body by the space of thyrty yere / that he neuer ete brede of whete / ne dranke wyne / ne vsed no potage / and wold haue neuer salte to make his mete sauery / and two tymes in the yere he wold drynke wyne / that was at ester and crystemas / and yet for to take aweye the sauour of the wyne / he wold put therin plente of y e water / & in his refeccion he wold take barly breed with asshes / and fasted euery day / & neuer ete but in the euen / In wynter ne somer he had but one clothyng / & that was the hayr nexte his body / a cote & a gowne / and yf it happed so that he gaue not his vesture to somme poure body / he wold were it tyl it were broken and torne / his bedde was enuyroned wyth asshes / hayre / and sacke clothe / And his heed laye no hyer thenne hys sholdres / but al day wepte and bare aboue his necke dyuerse relyques of sayntes / he ware none other clothyng / and he wente ofte barefote / and selde ware ony gyrdle / the lyf that he ladde was aboue mannes power / hys lyf was so strayte and harde that it was merueyle and pyte to see his flesshe / and was lyke a thynge not credyble and he dyd so many myracles / that yf his merytes had not goon before they shold haue ben trowed fantasmes / In a tyme he was herberowed in a place where alwey after sowper the tables were couerd whan alle men had sowped / wherof he meruayled and demaūded the hoost wherfore they couerd the tables ageyn after sowper / and the hoost sayd it was for hys neyghbours that came to drynke eche wyth other / And that nyght saynt germayn concluded to watche for to see what hit shold be / it was not longe after that there came in there a grete multitude of deuylles and sat atte table in liknes of men and wymmen / And whan the holy man sawe them / he commaunded them that they shold not departe / and thenne sente to awake the hoost and al the neyghbours and ghestys on al sydes / in suche wyse that euery man and woman were founden in theyr howses / and he maad al them to come and see yf they knewe ony of them / and they sayd nay / and thenne he shewed them that they were deuyls / of whome the peple was moche abasshed / by cause the deuyls mocked them so / And thenne saynt germayn coniured them / and wente theyr weye / & neuer after retorned / In a tyme Saynt lowe bysshop of troyes was byseged by the kynge actylle / and saynt lowe wente vpon the yate / and demaunded who he was that assyegyd and assayled them / and the kynge said to hym I am he actylle the scorge and rodde of god / and thenne the meke bysshop sayd to hym sore wepyng / I am lowe that haue wasted the flocke of god / and haue nede of the scorgyng of god and thenne saynt lowe commaunded to opene the yates / and alle the people of actyl were so by the wylle of god blynded / that they passed thorugh the towne and sawe no men of the cyte / ne dyd no hurte to no body / And thenne the blessyd saynt lowe toke saynt germayn with hym and wente in to bretaygne where as there were heresyes / But whan they were on the see there aroos a ryght grete tempeste / whyche by the merytes of saynt germayn was anone apeased / Thenne they were honestlye receyued of the people of the contrey / whos comyng the deuyls that saynt germayn had dryuen out of suche bodyes as were bis comyng / and whan they had been a whyle in englond / and had conuaynquysshed the heretykes / they retorned in to their contrees and propre places On a tyme it happed that saynt germayn laye seek of a malady in a strete and the strete was taken wyth fyre / & men counceylled hym to be borne thens for perylle of the fyre / and thenne he put hym self ageynst the fyre / and the flawme brente al aboute / and touched no thynge that germayn laye in / Another tyme he retorned in to bretaygne for the heresyes / and one of his dysciples folowed hym hastely and fyl seek and laye doun in a towne & there deyed / and whan saynt germayn retorned therby / he demaunded to see the sepulture of his dysciple whiche there was deed / and dyd doo opene hys sepulture / & he callyd hym by his name and demaunded hym what he dyd / & yf he wold no lenger goo wyth hym and that other answerd and sayd that he was wel / and alle thynges were to hym softe and swete / & wold nomore come here / and the holy man graunted it hym that he shold abyde in reste / And he remysed hym self in his graue and slepte in our lorde / •ten / had tolde their He prechyd on a tyme in the contre of bretaygne in suche wyse that the kyng of bretayne forbad hym his hows and his peple also / Thenne it happed that the kynges cowherde wente to the pasture with his kyen / and receyued hys porcyon atte kynges paleys / and bare it to his lytyl hows / Thenne wente saynt germayn and his felawshyp for to see where they myght be lodged / And the cowherde brought hem to hys hows / and sawe that they had grete hungre / but he had not mete for them and hym / this cowherde had but one calfe / he slewe it and gaue it to them and they toke it debonayrly of the litel good that he had / and whan they had sowped and sayd graces / saynt germayn dyd do gadre to gydre alle the bones of the calfe / and layed them vnder the skyn and after made his prayers to god / & anone thenne the calfe aroos al alyue & hole as he was tofore And the next day after saint germayn demaunded the kynge why he had for bode hym his hows / and the kynge was moche abasshed & c sayd saynt germayn to hym thou shalt nomore regne / but thou shalt l and as they of saxon shold fyght ageynst the brytons / and they sawe that they were but fewe / & sawe the holy man passe by / they called hym And thenne saynt germayn and hys felowes prechyd so longe to them that they came to grace of baptesme / And on ester day they caste of theyr armures / and by grete desyre of feyth purposed them to fyght / and whan the other herde that / they purposed to goo ageynst them hardely / for they were dysseuerd / and saynt germayn hydde hym alwey wyth his peple / & warned hem whan he cryed alleluya / they shold answer wyth one voys / and whan the sayntes had cryed alleluya / and the o had answerd / theyr enemyes had so grete drede / that they threwe al theyr harneys and armoures aweye / and wende certeynly that al the mounteyns shold falle on them / and also heuen / & so they fledde all afrayed / On a tyme as saynt germayn passed by angustynence / & wente to the tombe of saynt cassyen / he enquyred how it stood wyth hym / he answerd to hym out of the tombe wherin he laye & sayd I am in swete reste / and abyde the comyng of the redemour / & he said to hym reste in pees in the name of our lord and praye for vs deuoutely / that we may deserue the holy ioyes of the resurrexyon / and whan saint germayn came in rauenne / he was receyued moche honourably of Placyde the quene / and of valentynyen hir sone / and atte sowper she sente to hym a grete vessel of syluer ful of delycyous mete / The whiche he receyued / and gaue the mete to his seruauntes / & reteyned the vessel of syluer for to gyue to the poure / And in stede of this yefte / he sente to the quene a dysshe of wood or of tree & a barly loof the whiche she receyued gladly / and after dyd doo couer that dysshe with syluer and kepte it longe in grete deuocion / •ude not answere / Thenne •ue thy royame to one better than the / ••er On a tyme that the sayd quene had desyred hym to dyne wyth hyr / he accorded therto gladly / and by cause he was wery of trauayle / of fastyng & watchyng he came vpon an asse fro his hows vnto the paleys / And anone as he was at dyner his asse deyed / And whan the quene knewe that his asse was deed she was moche sorowful / & dyd do presente hym a right fayre and good hors / and whan the saynt sawe hym so rychely aourned & apparaylled he wold in no wyse take hit / but said shewe to me where myn asse is / For he that brought me hyder shal brynge me home ageyn / and thenne he wente to his asse that laye dede and sayd to hym lete vs retorne home ageyn / and anone the asse aroos / & shoke hym as he had rysen from slepe & that he had no harme / & thenne germayn remounted on his asse and rode home / But tofore or he departed fro rauenne he said that he shold not be longe in this worlde / and anone after he became seek of the feuers / & the seuenth day after he passed vnto our lord / And his body was born in to fraunce as he had requyred to the quene / And he deyed aboute the yere of our lord four hondred & xx / Saynt Germayn had promysed by hys lyue to saynt eusebe bysshop of versayl that whan he

promesses of saynt germayn / and that whiche he promysed lyuyng / he wold doo hit beyng deed / but it is not to be vnderstonde of the grete eusebe of versayl / that this was doon in his tyme For he deyed vnder valente themperour and fro the deth of hym vnto the dethe of saynt germayn was more than fyfty yere fro that one to that other / but thys was another eusebe xnder whome this said thynge was doon / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Germayn Here foloweth the lyf of saynt peter thexorcisce or deken SAynt peter the deken was bounden wyth chaynes of yron in pryson o sayd Saynt peter to hym that Ihesu cryste shold wel hele hyr / yf he wolde byleue in hym / To whome archēne answerd / I meruayle moche of the / by cause thou suffrest so moche for thy god And I see that he may not delyuer

double thy chaynes / and yf thenne thy god may delyuer the & also make my doughter hool / I shal byleue in hym / and whan that was done saynt peter cladde in whyte clothys holdyng the signe of the crosse apperyd to hym and thenne anone archenne fyl doun to his feet / and his doughter was made al hool / He thenne with al his hows receyued baptesme / and he lete out of pryson alle the crysten men

marcellyn preest / whan the prouost of Rome herde thys / he made al the crysten men come tofore hym / whom archenne gadred to gyder kyssyng theyr hondes and sayd That who wold come to be marterd shold come hardely wythout drede / And he that dare not come lete hym goo in pees where he wyl / and whan the prouoste knewe for certeyn that saynt peter and saynt marcellyn had baytysed them / he made them come tofore hym / and departed that one fro that other / and put them so in pryson And saynt marcellyn was layed naked vpon broken glasse without light or water / and saynt peter was enprysoned in a strayte place wherin he was strayned / Thenne came an aungel fro heuen and vnbonde saynt marcellyn & cladde hym and broughte hym wyth peter in to the hows of archenne / by cause they shold seuen dayes comforte the peple besyly / After whan he fonde not marcellyn in pryson where as he had sette hym / he sente for archenne / and commaunded hym and his howsholde to do sacrefyse and they wold not obeye to hym / He put thenne hym and his wyf in to a pytte in the erthe / Thenne whan saynt marcellyn and saynt peter herde telle thauenture of archenne / they came to hym & songe masse in the same pytte wyth seuen crysten men that deffendyd them / and after they sayd to the paynyms / we myght wel yf we wolde delyuer archenne and hyde our self / but we wyll doo neyther / Thenne the paynyms smote archenne wyth a swerde thorugh the body and slewe hym / and after stoned to dethe his wyf and his doughter / Thenne brought they saynt marcellyn & saynt peter to the blacke yle / and there byheded them / whiche place is called now candyda for theyr marterdom / & thus they suffred marterdō the yere of grace vij hondred foure score and seuen / and they that smote of theyr heedes sawe theyr sowles aourned wyth roses and precious stones borne vp to heuen by aungels / One dorotheus that was one of them that byheded them sawe it wherfore he became crysten / and lyued after an holy lyf / and after restyd in our lord / Thus enden the lyues of saint marcellyn and Peter Here foloweth of saint pryme and felician and of thynterpretacion first of theyr names PRimus is as moche to say as souereyn and grete and Felician is as moche to say as a blessed or happy olde man / Primus is sayd souerayn and grete in dygnyte for suffryng of hys marterdom / and puyssaunt for thopperacion of myracles / holy for the perfeccion of hys lyf / and blessyd for his glorious fraycion / Felician is sayd happy olde man not onely for the auncyente of tyme / but for the reuerence of dygnyte / for the

that he suffred his marterdom so gladly and so ioyously / he dyd hym to be tormented ageyn / & commaunded that no thynge sholde be mynystred to hym to ete / After this he maad saynt pryme to come

foloweth the lyf of saynt Barnabe the appostle / And first the interpretacion of his name BArnabe is as moche to say as the sone of hym that cometh / Or the sone of consolacion / or the sone of a prophete / or a sone concludyng / he is four tymes sayd a sone by foure maners of exposicions he is sayd sone in escripture by reason of generacion / of erudycyon / of ymytacion / and of adopcion / he was regenerate of Ihesu cryste by baptesme / And he was taughte by the gospel and folowyd hym by marterdom / & adopted by heuenly rewarde / and this was towchyng hym self / as towchyng other / he was comyng / comfortyng / prophecyeng / and concludyng / comyng in rennyng & prechyng oueralle and that apperyth / for he was felowe of saynt poule comfortyng poure pepl concluded a grete multitude of people & conuerted them to the feythe as it apperyth whan he was sente to antyoche / & that sayth the book called thactes of thappostles / as to the first he was a man & manlye to the second good as to the thyrd / ful of the holy ghoost / & as to the fourth trewe / his passyon bede compyled out of greek in to latyn / • & desolate to poure peple in gyuyng almesse / To desolate in sendyng epistles in the name of thappostles / prophecyeng for he floured by the spyrite of prophecye / in concludyng / for he Of saynt barnabe thappostle SAynt barnabe was a deken & was borne in cypre & was one of the lxxij disciples of our lord & is gretely praysed in thystorye of thactes of thappostles of many good thynges that were in hym for he was right wel enformed & ordynate / as wel to hym self as to god and to his neyghbour / he was wel ordynate in hym self after thre vertues that been in the sowle / that is to saye reson / desire & strengthe / he had reson enlumyned with the clerenes of veray knowleche / herof is said in thactes of the appostles the xiiij chappyter / it is said there that there were in the chirche of antyoche doctours prophetes & grete maisters in holy screpture / emonge whome were barnabe symon & many other grete clerkys / yet had he desyre wel ordynate & expurged fro the dust of al worldely affeccion / & therof is founde in thactes of appostles the fourth chappytre / that he solde a felde that he had / and the valewe & prys therof he layed at the feet of the appostles / & the glose sayth saynt barnabe shewed to vs heryn that we oughte leue the thynge that men shold not put theron theyr desyre ne theyr hurte / & taughte vs to despyse golde & syluer / by that that he layed the syluer atte feet of thappostles / yet had he the vertu of the sowle whiche is callyd strengthe wel affermyd wyth prowesse of pacyence / and that may we see on the grete thynges and hye / that he emprysed / and on the grete penaunces that he dyd / and on the grete tormentes & paynes that he suffred / Grete thynges thenne he enprysed / and that may we see whan he took vpon hym to conuerte soo grete a cytee as was antyoche / For whan Saynt poul came in to Iherusalem / anone after his conuersion / & wold accompanye hym with the disciples they fledde alle aweye lyke as sheep do fro wulues / But barnabe wente anone to hym and toke and brought hym in to the companye of thappostles / after he enforced his body with grete penaunces that he dyd / for he tormented hit wyth aspre and harde fastynges / yet was saynt barnabe a man enforced to suffre paynes and tormentes / For he and saynt Poule abandonned their lyues oueral for the loue of our lord Ihesu Cryste / Secondly he was ordeyned as towchyng to god in beryng auctoryte / Mageste and bounte / he bare honoure reuerence vnto the grete auctorytee of god / after that we fynde in the actes of appostles the xiij chappytre / whan the holy ghoost sayd / Take ye to me a parte barnabe and powle for to do the offyce that I haue chosen them to / yet saynt barnabe bare honoure to the grete mageste of god / For whan there shold be doon reuerence to hym and sacrefyse / as to a god / and was called Iupyter as he that wente before / and they callyd powle mercurye / as a fayr and wyse speker / anone barnabe and poule rente and tare theyr cotes / and cryed alle on hye ye peple what doo ye we ben mortal as ye be / whiche warne you to torne and conuerte to the veray god lyuyng Ihesu cryste / after saynt barnabe bare reuerence to the bounte of god after that is founden in the actes of appostles the xv chappytre / Somme conuerses of the Iewes wold mynysshe the bounte of the grace of god / and sayd that this grace that our lord had doon in his passyon suffysed not to saue vs wythout circumsycion / ageynst this errour poule & barnabe withstood vygorously and shewed to them appertely that the grace and bounte that god hath doon / is suffycient without the lawe to our sauacion / After they sente to the appostles this questyon / the which they sente anone thorugh the world epystles ageynst thys folysshe errour / after saynt barnabe was right strongly wel ordeyned ageynste hys neyghbours / For al them that were commysed in his cure / he nourisshed and fedde / in worde / in exaumple / & in bentfaytes / In word for he pronoūced to them the holy word of god and the gospel / herof is sayd in the actes of thappostles that poule and barnabe abode in antyoche prechyng the worde of god / that may be seen by the grete multitude of peple that he conuerted in the cyte of antyoche / for they conuerted so moche peple there that the dysciples lost theyr specyal name / & were callyd crysten men as the other / yet nourisshed he them that he had charge of by good ensaumple / for his lyf was to al them that sawe hym / as a myrrour of holynes / & thexemplayr of al religyon / For he was in al his werkys noble & hardy / & wel embelisshed of alle good werkys / & was ful of the holy ghoost and enlumyned & light in the feyth of our lord / al thyse foure thynges been touched of hym in thactes of thappostles / yet nourisshed he them by benefaytes in two maners / that is in almesse temporal in admynystryng to the poure their necessyte / and in other almesse spyrytuel / in foryeuyng alle rancour and euyl wylle / The fyrst almesse dyd saynt barnabe / for he bare to suche as were in right grete pouerte & myserye / that as was nedeful for them to lyue / For after that we fynde in the actes of thappostles / there was a grete famyne in the tyme of claudyus themperour / whiche famyne had agabus prophecyed / and by cause the dysciples that wold retorne to theyr brethern in to Iudee / sente vnto the moste auncien theyr almesses by the handes of barnabe and poule / the second almesse dyd saynt barnabe whan he pardoned hys angre to Ioh̄n surnamed marke / For whan the said Ioh̄n whiche was one of the dysciples was departed from the companye of barnabe and of poule / he repented hym & wold retorne to them & barnahe foryaue it hym / & toke hym ageyn to his dysciple / but poule wold not receyue hym wyth hym / Neuerthelesse that whiche was doon bytwene them bothe / was by good entencion / for in this that barnabe took hym ageyn / we may see the swetenes of his pyte / & in this that saynt poul wold not receyue hym is shewed the grete fauour of right that was in hym / after that the glose saith actuum xv / by cause this Ioh̄n had be tofore the maister of the lawe to deffende the lawe of Ih̄u cryste And had not conteyned hym vygorously for to repreue them / but had ben neglygent / For thys reason Saynt Powle wold not accorde to receyue hym in to the companye of the other / Neuerthelesse this departyng that Ioh̄n was thus departed fro the companye of saynt powle & fro the other was for no vyce that was in hym but for y e sharpenes & enspyryng of the holy ghoost to thende that they myght preche in dyuers places / after that it happed after for whā barnabe was on a tyme in the cite o callyd Ioh̄n / but thou shalt be called right hye enhaunced / & whan he had tolde this to his cosyn saynt barnabe he answerd & said to hym / kepe y e wel that thou telle this vysyon to no man / for in the same forme he apperyd to me / that nyght after when saynt barnabe & saynt paule had longe prechyd in the cyte of antyoche / thaūgel of god apperyd to saynt poule & said to hym goo hastelye in to Iherusalem / for thou shalt fynde there somme of the brethern that abyde the / thenne barnabe wold goo in to cipre to vysyte his frendys & kynne that were there / & saynt poul wold goo to Iherusalem / thus departed that one fro that other by entysement of the holy ghoost that so had ordeyned hit / & whan saynt poul had shewed to saynt bernabe thys that thaungel said / saynt bernabe answerd to hym / the wylle of god be done lyke as he hath ordeyned hit / I goo now in to cipre / & more herafter shal I not see the / for there shal I ende my lyf thenne he humbly knelid doun & fyl to his feet wepyng / & saynt poule whych had compassyon of hym / said vnto hym thyse wordes by consolacion / Bernabe w named helyas whyche by his enchaūtement had taken aweye the sight from sōme / & after gyuen it to them ageyn / he was moche contrarye to them & wold not suffre them entre in to the temple / after this barnabe saw on a day men & wymmen beyng alle nakyd rēnyng thorugh the towne / & made thēne grete feste / wherof he was moche angry & gaue his malediccion & curse to the t t the Iewes came & toke hym / & ladde hym thorugh the cite with grete shame & wold haue delyuerd hym to the Iuge of the cite for to punysshe hym / & to put hym to deth / but whan they herde say that a grete & a puyssaūt mā was come in to the cite which was named eusebyus / & was of the lignage of themperour nero / the Iewes had doubte that he wold take hym out of her hondes & lete hym goo / and therfore anone they bonde a corde aboute his necke & drewe hym out of the cite / & there anone brent hym / but yet the

Anthonye / and spytte on hyt / and bete wel hym that brought the lettre / And sente agayn to saynt Anthonye thyse wordes / yf thou hast so grete charge of thy monckes come to me and I shal gyue to the my disciplyne / But it happed that the xv day after / he mounted vpon an hors ouer debonayr / And neuertheles whan the horse felte hym vpon hym he bote hym on the legges and thyes / that he deyde on the thyrd daye / It happed an other tyme that the hermytes were comen to saynt Anthonye and demaunded of hym a collacion / Thenne sayd saynt Anthonye / doo ye thys that is wreton in the gospel / yf one gyue to the a stroke on that one cheke / shewe hym that other / And they answere we may not doo so / Thenne said he / suffre ye it ones debonayrly / they answerd we may not / Thenne said saynt Anthony to hys seruaunt / gyue them to drynke good wyn / For thyse monckes ben ouer delycious / Fayr brethern put your self to prayer / For ye haue moche grete nede / Atte laste saynt Anthonye assembled the heremytes / And gaf to them the peas / and deyde and departred out of thys world holyly whan he was of the age of an honderd and v yere / praye we to hym / that he praye for vs Here endeth the lyf of saynt Anthonye Of saynt Fabian and thynterpretacion of hys name first FAbian is as moche to saye as makyng soueuerayn beatitude or blessidnes / that is to wyte in getyng in thre maner wises or maners / First by right and reson of adopcion / of byeng in achate and by vyctorye / Of saynt Fabian the martir SAynt Fabian was a cytezeyn & bourgeys of Rome / And it happed whan the pope was deed / that the people assembled for to chese another pope / And saynt fabian cam to the election for to knowe who shold be electe and chosen to that dygnyte / And anone a whyte douue descended from heuen / & rested vpō his hede / And wh t they merueylled moche And all they by comyn accorde chees hym for to be pope / Thys holy man fabian after whan he was pope / he ordeyned thurgh out all the contrees vij dekens and to them vij subdekens / for to wryte the lyues of martirs / Ther was an Emperour in his tyme named phylyppe / whyche was moche synful and cam boldly in the vygyle of ester / in to the chyrche for to be houselyd and cōmyned / whom the pope droof away / and denyed to hym the comunyon / vntyl he had goon and shryuen hym of hys synnes / and lete hym stonde emong the seculiers / Thys holy pope also / ordeyned the crysme in the chyrche / ¶ Thenne atte laste whan he had ben pope xiij yere / decius themperour comanded to smyte of hys heed / And so he was crowned with the crowne of martirdom / the yere of our lord CCliij •n the peple sawe y Of saynt Sebastian and first thynterpretacion of hys name SEbastian is sayd of sequens and beatitudo / and astin and ana / that is to saye folowyng the blessydnes / of the heuenly cyte / and thys he gace v maner wyses after saynt Austyn / that is to saye he gate by pouerte the regne / with sorow Ioye / with labour reste / with trowble glorye / & with deth lyf / Or sebastianus is said of basto / For by the helpe of cryst he flourid in the chyrche / And had a custom̄e to comforte the marters in their torm̄tis ¶ Of saynt Sebastian SAynt Sebastian was a mā of grete faith a good crysten man / And was born in Herbōne / and after taught & endoctryned in the cite of melan & was so wel byloued of dyoclesian & maximian emperours of Rome / that they made hym maistre & duc of their mayne & power / and alleway wold haue hym in theyr presence / And he was alleway wyth them in habyte of a knyght / & was gyrde with a gyrdle of gold aboue / lyke as was vsed / And all this dide he not for Iolyte / ne for cause that he dredde deth or to deye for the loue of Iesu cryst / but he dyde it for to comforte the crystē men in their bileue / whan they were in destresse for to renye the faith for drede of tormētis of their body / It happed that ij brethern germayns very crysten men and noble of lignage named marcus & marcellianus were taken and constrayned by thēperours for to worshipe & doo sacrefyse vnto thydolles / And ther was gyuen to thē respite of xxx dayes to be in prison without to receyue deth for their crystē faith / within whiche tyme they myght coūseyll & aduyse them self whether they wold do sacrefise to thydolles / or to leue / & their frendes were suffred in this tyme of respite to come to thē in prison / for tentrete & reuoke them fro their faith for to saue their lyues / Thēne cam their parentis & frendes to them & bygan to saye / whens cometh this hardnes of herte / that ye despise the old age of your fader and moder whyche ben now olde / ye gete vnto thē new sorowes / the grete payne that they had in your byrthe / was not so grete as the sorow that they haue now / and the sorow that your moder suffreth is not to reherse / wherfor right dere frendes we praye you that ye wylle to thyse sorowes put somme remedye / And departe you and leue the errour of the crysten men / And anon after thyse wordes theyr moder cam and entred in / in cryeng and teryng the heeres of her hede / in shewyng her pappes and sayd alle wepyng / Alas I am meschaunt and vnhappy that lese my two sones / that I haue gyuen souke and nourisshyd so swetely / Thou fair sone thou were swete & debonaire to me / And to that other she said / thou were lyke and semblest wel thy fader / Alas to what meschief and sorowe am I delyuerd / for you my fayr sones / I lese my sones which by their owen will goon for to deye / My most dere chyldren haue ye mercy on your sorouful moder / that am in so grete mesease / and in so grete / Wepyngis for you / O pour caytyf that I am what shal I doo that lose my two sones and to the deth I see them goo / by theyr fre wyll / Alas thys is a newe maner of deth / for to desyre the deth / to fore it come / The moder had vnneth said her complaynt / but that theyr fader was brought bytwene ij seruantes whiche at thentre shewde to hys sones dust vpon the pouerte of hys hoore hede And cryed Alas I sorowful caytyf come to the deth of my two sones / which by theyr owen agreement wyll deye / O my ouerderest sones that were the sustenance and staf of myn olde age / swetely nourysshed and taught & lerned in science / what is thys open folisshnes and rage that is comen on you and causeth you to loue and desire so the deth / ther was neuer suche a folye ne rage seen in the world / O ye my frendes come forth and helpe me to bywepe my chyldren / ye that haue hertes of pyte / And ye old and yong wepe ye / And I wyl wepe so moche / that I see not the deth of my sones / In the whyle that the fader thus wepte and said / cam the two wyues of thyse ij sones / whiche bare in their armes their chyldreen / whiche wepyng and cryeng said / Saye ye now that ben our dere husbondes / In what ward leue ye vs and your chyldren / Alas what shal bycome of vs / our chyldren and our goodes / that for your sake shal be lost Alas caytyues that we be / what thyng is to vs / happened / how haue ye herte of yron / in what maner may ye so be harded so out of nature / and so cruel that also despyse your fader & moder / and refuse all your frendes / chace aaway your wyues / and renye and forsake your chyldren / and with your will delyuer your self for to deye shamefully / Of thise lamentable wordes to fore wretō / the ij said sones marcus & marcellianus were so abasshed and their hertes mollified / that almost were retorned fro the crysten faith / & wold for the fauour of their parētis & frendes haue don sacrefyse / to thydolles / but at thise wordes was saynt sebastian / as a knyght / whan he sawe thē thus trauelled & so amolisshid / anon cam to thē & said / O ye right noble knyghtes of Ih̄u cryst wise & hardy which ben comē to the victorye / & now goo abacke & for a fewe blaundissyng wordes vayne & myserable ye wyll lose the victorye { per } manable / lese ye not the euerlayng lif / for the blaūdysshyng wordes of wymen / be ye exāple to other cristen mē for to be strong in the faith / Addresse ye your hertes aboue y e world / & lose ye not your crowne for the wepynges of your wyues & childrē / They that now wepe certes shold this day be glad & Ioyous / yf that they knewe / y t ye know / They we ne that ther be none other lif / but this / which they see to fore their eyen / which after this shal come to nought / yf they knewe what is that other lyf / without deth & thithoute heuynesse / in which is Ioye permanable & euerlastyng wythoute doubte / they wold haste thē for to goo with you vnto that lyf / and shold repute this lyf as vayne / For it is ful of myserye & also fals / & sith the begynnyng of the world hath deceyued all his frendes / & conquerd all them y t haue affiance in hym / For she hath lyed in her promyse / yet doth she dayly in this lyf more harme / For she maketh gloutons / And other she maketh lecherons / she maketh theeues for to slee / And the angry cruell / and the lyars fals & deceyuable / She putteth discorde emong wedded and maryed peple / and debate emong the peasible / By the world cometh alle malyce / and alle felonnye / Thys euylle doo they / that in this lyf putte theyr desyres / And wene longe to lyue therin / And whan they y t thus serue the world / haue vsed theyr lyf in dooyng thise euyll aforsaid Thenne gyueth she to them her doughter that is the deth perpetuelle / that is the reward that the lyf of thys world gyueth to her seruātes / that departe frō thys world despourueyed / And bere nothyng with them but their synnes / After thys / saynt sebastien torned hym to their parentis and frendes and said to them in thys maner / O ye my frendes lo here the lyf of thys world which deceyueth you in suche wise / that ye discounseylle your frendes fro the euerlastyng lyf / ye destrouble your chyldren that they shold not come to the companye of heuene / and to the honoure permanable / and to thamytye of themperour celestyall / by your folyssh wordes / and your false wepynges / yf they shold assente to your repeell / they shold but a whyle dwelle wyth you / And after shold departe fro your companye / where ye shold see them in tormentes that shold neuer ende / where as cruel flam̄e deuoureth the soules of mescreants / and worshippers of ydollis / And the dragons eten the lippes of cursid men / And the serpents destroye them that ben euyll / there where is herd nothyng but wayllyngis / wepyngis / and horryble cryes of sowles whyche brenne contynuelly in the fyre of helle / and euer shal brenne without deyeng / Suffre ye / that your sones escape thyse tormentes / And thynke how ye may escape / And late thē suffre deth for the loue of Ihesu cryste / thenke not / but they whan they shal be thus departed fro you / goon for to make redy your place and your mansion / in heuen / where ye and youre chyldren may be in Ioye perpetuel / In thys houre and tyme that saynt sebastyan y t was in habite of a knyght clad with a mantel / and gyrd wyth a gyrdle of gold and had sayd thyse wordes anone cam a grete light in the whyche appiered a yonglyng clad with a whyte mantel emong vij angellis / And gaf to saynt sebastyan the peas sayeng / thou shalt be alleway with me / Thys sawe the wyf of nychostratus named Zoe / in whos hows marcus & marcellianus were in pryson whyche had ben muet & dombe vj yere by a sekenes that she had / But she had vnderstāden that / whyche saynt sebastian had said / & had seen the lyght aboute hym / And she fyll doun to hys feet / And by signes of her hādes made prayers to hym / And after whan saynt Sebastyan knewe that she had loste her speche / Anone he said to her / yf I be the seruant of Ihesu cryste and yf all that / that I haue said be trewe / thenne I praye hym that he wyl rendre to the thy speche agayn / that opened the mouth of Zacharye the prophete / And anon escryed thys woman moche hye and said / The worde that thou hast said is veray trewe / And blessyd be thou / And the word of thy mouth and blessyd ben alle they that by the byleue in Ihesu cryst the sone of god / For I haue seen certaynly vij angellis to fore the holdyng a book / in whiche was wreton all that / whiche thou hast said / Blessid be all they that byleue that / whiche thou hast said / And cursid be they that byleue the not / And Nichostratus husbonde of this woman and the fader and moder and alle the frendes of marcellianus & marcus / receyueden the crysten faith / And were all baptised by policarpus the preest / vnto the nombre of lxxviij persones men wymen and chyldren / And ten dayes duryng they abode to gydre in orysons and in prayers / and thankyd god of hys benefettes / Emong them was tarquyllynus fader vnto the holy martirs aforsaid whyche had xj yere duryng the gowte in hys feet & handes / And assone as policarpus had baptysed hym / he bicam as hool and sound in his feet & hondes as a chyld After the ten dayes agrestyn / and Comatyn prouostes of Rome made Tarquillinus their fader to come to for hym / And demaunded of hym / how hys sones were aduysed and counseylled / And he answerd moche wel dyde ye whan ye gaf to them respyte / For in the mene tyme they that shold haue deyde haue founde lyf and Ioye / And the prouost supposed that hys sones had ben torned / And said to mo and they may dwelle in peas / And tarquillinus said / gentyl man yf thou wylt Iustly adoure & werke aboute me and my sones / thou shal fynde that the name of crysten men is of grete vertue / And the prouoste said tarquillinus art thou wood / And he answerd / I haue ben out of my wytte / but assone as I bileued in Ihesu cryst / I resseyued helth of body and of sowle / The prouoste said I see wel / that the respyte of thy sones haue brought the in errour / Tarquillinus sayde / knowe of what werkis come errour / The prouost bad hym saye And he said / The first errour is to leue the waye of lyf / and goo by the waye of deth / for to dyspute that men whyche ben deed for to be goddes / and to adoure their ymages / made of wood or of stone / The prouoste said / thenne be they no goddes that we adoure / Tarquillinus said It is redde in our bokes / what men they were that ye adoure for goddes / how euyl they lyued and how meschauntly they deyed / Saturnus whom ye worshippe for god was lord of Crete / and ete the flessh of hys chyldren / how is not he one of your goddes / And Iupiter / hys sone whom ye adoure / whyche slewe hys fader / and toke hys suster to hys wif what euyl was thys / how art thou in grete errour / that adourest thys cursid men / And saist to the ymage of stone thou art my god / And to the stock of tree / helpe me / The prouost said yf ther be none but one god inuisible / that ye adoure / wherfor thenne adoure ye Ihesu cryst / whome the Iewes crucyfyed Tarquillinus answerd / Yf thou knowest a ryng of gold / in whyche were a precious stone lyeng in the myre of a valeye / thou woldest sente thy seruāts for to take vp this ryng / And yf they myght not lefte it vp / thou woldest vnclothe thy self / of thy clothes of silke and doo one a course cote and woldest helpe to take vp thys rynge and make grete feste / The prouost said wherfor hast thou put forth this proposiciō now Tarquillinus answerde / For to shewe to the / that we adoure one only god / The prouost said what vnderstondest y u by thys ryng / Tarquillinus said / the gold of the rynge is the body humayne / And the precious stone signefieth the sowle whiche is enclosed in the body / The body and the sowle make a man / lyke as the gold and the precious stone make a rynge / And moche more precioous is the man to Ihesu cryst / than the rynge is to the / Thou sendest thy seruants for to take vp this ryng out of the dyrte or myre / And they may not / Thus sente god in to thys world the prophetes for to drawe the humayne lygnage out of thordure of synnes / and they myght not doo it And lyke as thou sholdest leue thy ryche clothis and clothe the with a course cote / and woldest descende in to the pryue and put thy handes in to foule ordure to take vp the rynge / Ryght so the mageste of god hydde the lyght of hys dyuynyte by a carnal vestement whyche he toke of our nature humayne And clad hym therwith / and descendeth fro heuen / and cam here bynethe in to the pryue of this world / and put hys hondes / in thordure of oure myseryes in suffryng hungre and thurst / And toke vs vp out of the fylthe / & weessh vs fro our synnes by the water of baptesme / And thus he whyche dispyseth the by cause thou shold descende in a foule habyte to take vp the ryng thou myghtest wel put hym to deth / Thus all they that renye or despise Ih̄u cryst / by cause he humbled hym self for to saue man / maye in no wyse escape for the deth of helle / The prouost said I see wel that thyse ben but fables / Thou hast take respyte for thy sones / knowest thou not well that thēperour our lord is cruell ayenst crysten men Tarquillinus said it is folye to doubte more humayne puyssaunce / than the puyssaunce dyuyne They that ben cruel ayenst vs / maye wel tormente our bodyes / but they may not take fro our herte Ihesu cryst / Thenne the prouost put put tarquillinus in the handes of the sergeantis sayeng shewe to me the medycine by whiche thou art helyd of thy gowte / And I shal gyue to the gold without nombre / knowe thou that moche euyl shal come to them that selle & bye the grace of god / but yf thou wilt be hole of the maladye of the gowte / byleue in Ihesu cryst / and thou shal be as hole as I am / The prouoste said brynge hym to me that hath heled the / Tarquillinus wente to polycarpus / & said to hym alle thys / And brought hym wyth saynt sebastian vnto the prouost and enformed hym in the faith And he praid hem that he myght haue his helthe / And saynt sebastian sayd that he shold first renye hys ydollis / & yeue hym licence to breke them / and thenne he shold haue hys helthe / Thēne Comasyn the prouost said that hys seruants shold breke them / saynt sebastian said / they ben aferd and dar not breke them / And yf the fendis hurte ony of them by ony occasion the mysbyleuers wold saye / that they were hurte by cause they brake their goddes / And thenne policarpe and saynt sebastian destroyed moo than CC ydollis / Thenne said they to the prouost / why hast not thou receyued the helthe whyl shewed them a chābre whyche was light as had ben of sterris / whervpon hys fader had dyspendyd CC poys of gold / by which he knewe thyngis for to come / Thenne said saynt sebastian / as longe as thou kepest thys hole / thou maist neuer haue helth / And thenne he agrered it shold be broken / Tyburcien hys sone whyche was a noble yong man sayd playnly / that so noble a werke shold not be destroyed / how wel I wyl not be agayn my fadres helthe / thys wylle I wel that ther be ordeyned ij furneyses of fyre brennyng / and thenne I wyll that ye destroye thys werke / and yf my fader haue hys helthe / I shal be content / And yf he receyue not hys helthe thenne I will that ye ij shal be brent in thyse ij furneyses of fyre all quyck / And saynt sebastian saide / be it / as thou hast said / And forthwyth they wente and breke the chambre / & in the mene whyle / the angele of our lord appyered to the prouost and said hys helthe was gyuen to hym / And anon he was all hool / and ranne after hym for to haue kyssed his fete / but he denyed hym For he had not receyued baptesme / And thenne he and Tyburcien hys sone wyth a MCCCC of theyr famylye were baptysed / Thenne Zoe was taken of the mescreants and was tormēted so longe that she gaf vp the spirite And whan tarquillinus herd that / he cam forth and said / Alas why lyue we so longe / wymen goon to fore vs to the crowne of martirdom / And with in a fewe dayes after / he was stoned to deth / And Tyburcien was comanded that he shold goo barefoot vpon brennyng coles / or ellis doo sacrefise to thydollis / And thenne he made the signe of the crosse vpon the coles / and wente on them bare foot / And he said me thynketh I goo vpon Roose flowres in the name of our lord Ihesu cryst / To whom fabien the prouoste said / It is not vnknowen to vs that your Ihesu cryst is a techar of Sorcerye / To whō Tyburcien said / holde thy peas thou cursid wretche / For thou art not worthy to nempne so worthy / so holy / ne so swete a name / Thenne the prouost was wroth / and comanded to smyte of hys heed / and so he was martred / And thenne marcellianus and marcus were sore tormentid and bound to a pyler / and as they were so bounden they seyden / loo how good & Ioyeful it is / brethern to dwelle to gydre To whom the prouost said / ye wretchis doo away your madnes / and delyure your self / And they sayde / we were neuer so wel fedde / we wold that thou woldest late vs stonde here / tyl that the spirites shold departe out of our bodyes / And thenne the prouost comāded that they shold be percid thurgh the body with speris / And so they fulfilled their martirdom / after this saynt sebastian was accused to thēperour that he was crysten / Wherfore dyoclesian themperour of Rome made hym come to fore hym / And said to hym I haue alleway loued the wel / and haue made the maistre / of my palays / how thēne hast thou be crysten pryuely ayenst my helthe and in despyte of our goddes / Saynt sebastian said / allewaye I haue worshyppid Ihesu cryst for thy helthe / and for thestate of Rome / And I thynke for to praye and demande helpe of thydollis of stone / is a grete folye wyth thyse wordes dyoclesian was moche angry and wroth / and comanded hym to be ladde to the felde / and there to be bounden to a stake / for to be shotte at / And the archers shotte at hym tyl he was as ful of arowes as an hirchon is ful of prickis / And thus lefte hym there for deed The nyght after cam a crysten woman for to take hys body and to burye it / but she fonde hym a lyue / and brought hym to her hows / and toke charge of hym tyl he was all hool / Many crysten men cam to hym whyche counseylled hym to voyde the place / but he was comforted / and stode vpon a stappe where themperour shold passe by / and said to hym / the bysshoppis of thydolles deceyue you euyll / whyche accuse the crysten men to be contrayre to the comyn prouffyt / of the cyte / that praye for your estate / & for the helthe of Rome / dyoclesyan said arte not thou sebastyen / whom we comanded to be shoten to deth / And saynt Sebastian saide / therfor our lord hath rendred to me lyf / to thende that I shold telle you / that euylle and cruelly ye doo persecucions vnto crysten men / Thenne made dyoclesyan hym to be brought in to pryson in to hys palays / And to bete hym so sore wyth stones tyl that he deyde / And the tyrauntis threwe hys bodye in to a grete pryuee / by cause the crysten men / shold make no feste to burye hys body / ne of hys martredom / but saynt sebastian appyerid after to saynt lucyne a glorious wydowe / And said to her in suche a pryue shalt thou fynde my body hangyng at an hoke / whyche is not defouled with none ordure / whan thou hast wasshed it / thou shal burye it at Cathacombes by the appostlis / And the same nyght she and her seruantes accomplysshyd alle that sebastian had comanded her / he was martred the yere of our lord CClxxxvij / And seynt gregory telleth in the first boke of h wedded was prayd for to goo wyth other wymen to the dedicacion of the chyrche of sebastian / and the nyght to fore she was so moeued in her flessh / that she myght not absteyne her from her husbond / And on the morn she hauyng gretter shame of men than of god wente theder / and anon as she was entryd in to the oratorye where the relyques of saynt sebatian were / the fende toke her and tormentid here byfore all the people / And thenne the preest toke the couerture of the aulter and couerd her / And thēne the deuyl assaylled the preest / her frendes lad her to thenchauntours / that that they shold enchaunte the fende / but assone as they began thenchaunte by the Iugemēt of god a legion of deuylles entryd in to her / that is vjMvjClxvj / and vexid her more sharply than to fore / And an holy man named formatus by hys prayers heled her / It is redde in the gestes of y e lōbardis that in the tyme of kynge gylberte all ytalye was smeton wyth so greet a pestilence / that vnnethe they that were alyue myght burye the dede / And this pestylence was most at Rome and pauye / Thenne the good Angele was seen vysybly of many and an euyl Angele folowyng beryng a staf whom le bad smyte and slee / And as many strokes as he smote an hows / so many deede persones were born out of it / Thenne at laste it was shewed to one by goddes grace / that this pestylence shold not cesse / tyl that they had made an aulter to saynt sebastian at pauye / whiche thenne was made in the chyrche of saynt peter / and anone the pestylence seassed / And thyder fro rome relyques of saynt sebastian were brought / And saynt Ambrose in his preface saith thus / O lord the blood of thy blessyd martir saynt sebastian was shedd for the confession of thy name / he hath shewed thy meruaylles / that they prouffyte in infirmyte vertue and gyueth to our studyes prouffyt / and to them not stedfast to the it gyueth ayde and helpe / Thenne late vs praye to this holy martir saynt sebastian / that he praye vnto our lord that we may be delyuerd from all pestylence and sodeyn deth / and so departe aduysedly hens that we may come to euer lastyng Ioye and glorye in heuen / •n I shal see / how thy sones shal make sacrefyse to thydolles / by whom thou •s we brake thydollis / thou kepest yet thy mysbyleue / or ellis kepest yet som̄e ydollis / Thenne he •s dyaloges / that a woman of tuskane whych was newe Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Sebastian And next foloweth of saynt Agnes / and first thynterpretacion of her name AGnes is said of agna a lambe / For she was humble and debonayr as a lambe / or of agno in greke / whyche is to saye debonayr / and pyteous / For she was debonayr and mercyful / Or agnes of agnoscendo / for she knewe the waye of trouthe / and after thys saynt Austyn saith / trouthe is opposed ayenst vanyte / falsenes / & doublenes / For thyse thre thyngis were taken from her / for the trouthe that she had / ¶Of saynt Agnes THe blessyd virgyne seynt Agnes was moche wyse and wel taught as saynt Ambrose wytnesseth / and wrote her passyon she was fayr of vysage / but moche fayrer in the crysten fayth / she was yong of age / & aged in wytte / For in the xiij yere of her age / she lost the deth that the world gyueth / And fonde lyf in Ihesu cryst / whyche whan she cam fro scole / the sone of the perfecte of Rome for themperour louyd her / And whan hys fader and moder knewe it / they offred to gyue moche Rychesse wyth hym / yf he myght haue her in maryage / And offryd to saynt Agnes precyous gēmes and Iewellis / whyche she refused to take / wherof it happed that the yong man was ardauntly esprysed in the loue of saynt Agnes / and came agayn and toke wyth hym more precious & Rycher adournementes / made wyth all maner of precious stones / And as wel by hys parentes as by hym self offred to saynt agnes Ryche yeftes /

of euyllys / and morsell of deth / and departe / And knowe thou that I am preuented / and am loued of another louer / whych hath gyuen to me many better Iewellis / whych hath fyanced me by his fayth / And is moche more noble of lygnage than thou art / & of estate / he hath clad me wyth precyous stones / and wyth Iewellis of golde / he hath sette in my vysage a signe / that I receyue none other espowse but hym / And hath shewde me ouer grete tresours / whiche he must gyue me / yf I abyde wyth hym / I wyl haue none other spowse but hym / I wyl seche none other / In no maner may I leue hym / wyth hym am I ferme and fastned in loue / whyche is more noble more puyssant / & fayrer than ony other whos loue is moche swete and gracious of whom the chambre is now redy for to receyue me / where the virgynes syngyn meryly / I am now embraced of hym / of whome the moder is a vyrgyne / And hys fader knewe neuer woman / to whom the angelles serue / the sonne and the mone merueylle them of hys beaute / whos werkes neuer faylle whos Rychesses neuer mynusshe / by whos odour dede men reyse agayn to lif by whos touchyng the seke men be conforted / whos loue is chastyte / To hym I haue gyuen my faith / To hym I haue comanded my herte / whan I loue hym thenne am I chaste / and whan I touche hym thēne am I pure and clene / And whan I take hym thenne am I a virgyne / Thys is the loue of my god whan the yong man had herd all this he was despayred / as he that was taken in blynde loue / and was ouer fore tormented in so moche that he laye doun seke in hys bedde for the grete sorowe that he had / Thenne cam the fysiciens & anon knewe hys maladye / and sayd to hys fadre that he languysshid of carnal loue / that he had to som̄e woman Thenne the fader enquyred and knewe that it was thys woman / And dyde doo speke to seynt agnes for hys sone and said to her how hys sone languysshid for her loue / seynt agnes answerd that in no wise she wold breke the faith of her first husbond / vpon that / the prouost demāded who was her first husbond of whom she so moche auaunted / and in hys power so moche trusted / Thenne one of her seruauntes said that she was crysten / and that she was so enchaunted / that she said Ihesu cryste was her espowse / And whan the prouoste herde that she was crysten / the prouost was moche glad by cause to haue power on her / For thenne the crysten peple were in the wylle of the lord / yf they wold not renye theyr god and theyr byleue / all theyr goodes shold be forfayted / wherfore thēne the prouoste made saynt agnes to come in Iustice / And he examyned her swetely / and after cruelly by menaces / Saynt agnes wel comforted sayd to hym / doo what thou wylt / For my purpoos shalt thou neuer chaunge / & whan she sawe hym nowe flateryng and now terrybly angry / she scorned hym / And the prouost said to her beyng all Angry / One of two thyngis thou shalt chese / eyther doo sacrefyse to our goddes wyth the vyrgyns of the goddes vesta / or goo to the bordell to be abandonned to alle that thyder come to the grete shame and blame of alle thy lygnage / Saynt Agnes answerd / yf thou knewest who is my god / thou woldest not saye to me suche wordes / but for as moche as I know y e vertue of my god / I sette nothyng by thy menaces / For I haue his angele which is kepar of my body / Thenne the Iuge all araged made to take of her clothys and all nakyd to be ledde to the bordell And thus saynt agnes that refused to doo sacrefyse to thydollys / was delyueryd nakyd to goo to the bordell / but anon as she was vnclothed god gaf to her suche grace that the heeris of her heed bycam so longe / that they couerd all her body to her feet / so that her body was not seen / And whan saynt agnes entred in to the bordell / anon she fonde thangele of god redy for to defende her / and enuyronned saynt agnes with a bryght clernes in suche wise that noman myht see her ne come to her / There made she of the bordel her oratorye And in makyng her prayers to god / she sawe to fore her a whyte vesture / And anon therwith she clad her / and saide / I thanke the Ihesu cryst whyche accomptest me wyth thy virgyns and hast sente me thys vesture / Alle they that entred made honour and reuerence to the grete clerenes that they sawe a boute saynt Agnes / And cam oute more deuoute and more clene than they entred / Atte laste cam the sone of the prouoste with a grete cōpanye / for taccomplysshe his foule desires and lustes And whan he sawe hys felaws come out and yssue all abasshyd / he mocqued them and callyd them cowardis And thenne he all araged entryd for taccomplyssh hys euyl wyll / and whā he cam to the clerenes / he auaunced hym for to take the virgyne / And anon the deuyl toke hym by the throte and strangled hym that he fyl doun deed / And whan the prouoste herde thyse tidynges / of his sone / he ranne wepyng to the bordel / and began cryeng to saye to saynt agnes / O thou cruel woman why hast thou shewde thyn enchantem̄t on my sone / and demaunded of her how hys sone was deed and by what cause / To whom saynt agnes answerd he toke hym in to hys power / to whom he had abaundonned hys wylle / why ben not all they deed said he / that entred here to fore hym / For hys felawes sawe the myracle of the grete clernes and were aferd and wente theyr waye vnhurte / For they dyde honour to my god whyche hath clad me wyth thyse vestement / and hath kept my body / but your vylaynous sone / assone as he entred in to thys hows began to braye and crye / and whan he wold haue leyde honde vpon me / anon the deuyl slewe hym as thou seest / yf thou maye reyse hym said he / It may wel appere that thou hast not put hym to deth / And saynt agnes answerd how wel that thy creance is not worthy to impetre ne gete that of our lord / neuertheles by cause it is tyme that the vertue of god be shewed Goo ye all oute that I may make my prayer to god / And whan she was in her prayers / thangele cam and reysed hym to lyf / And anon he wente out / and bygan to crye wyth an hye voys / that the god of crysten men was very god in heuen and in erthe / and in the See / And that thydolles were vayne that they worshypped / whyche myght not helpe them self ne none other / Thenne the bysshops of thydolles made a grete discorde emonge the peple / so that alle they cryed / Take away this sorceresse and witche that torned mennes myndes / and alyeneth theyr wyttes / whā the prouoste sawe thyse merueylles he wold gladly haue delyuerd saynt agnes / by cause she had reysed hys sone but he doubted to be banysshyd / And sette in hys place a lyeutenaūt named aspasius / for to satisfye the peple / and by cause he coude not delyuere her / he departed soroufully / Thys asp and dyde do caste saynt Agnes therin / Anon as thys was doon the flamme departed in to two partyes / & brente them that made the discordes / & she abode alle hole wythout felyng the fyre / The peple wente that she had don all by enchauntement / Thenne made saynt agnes her oryson to god thankyng hym that she was escaped fro the paryll to lese her virgynyte / and also fro the brennyng of the flamme / And whan she had made her oryson / the fyre loste all hys hete / and quenchyd it aspasius for the doubtance of the peple comanded to put a swerd in her body / And so she was martred / Anon cam the crysten men and the parentis of saynt Agnes and buryed her body / but the hethen defended it / and caste so stones at them / that vnnethe they escaped / She suffred martirdom in the tyme of constantyn the grete / whyche began to regne the yere of our lord CCCix / Emong them that buryed her body ther was one Emerenciana whyche had be felaw to saynt Agnes / how be it she was not yet cristened / but an holy virgyne / she cam also to the sepulces of saynt agnes / whyche constātly repreued the gentyles / and of thē she was stoned to deth / and slayn / Anon thenne cam a erthe quaue / lightnyng / and thondre / that many of the paynems perisshed / so that for And the body of Emerencian was buryed by the body of saynt Agnes / It happed that whā the frendes of seynt Agnes watched at her sepulcre on a nyght / they sawe come a grete multitude of virgynes clad in vestymentes of gold and siluer / and a grete light shone to fore them / And on the right side / was a lambe more whyte than snowe / and sawe also saynt Agnes emong the virgynes / whyche said to her parentes / Take hede / and see that ye bewaylle me nomore as deed / but be ye Ioyeful wyth me / For with all thise virgynes Ihesu cryst haue gyue me most and dwellyng / And am with hym Ioyned in heuen / whō in erthe I loued wyth my thouht / And thys was the viij day after her passyō And by cause of thys vysion / holy chyrche maketh memoyre of her / the viij day of the feste after / whyche is called Agnetis secundo / Of her we rede an example / that in the chyrche of saynt agnes was a preest whych was named paulus / and allewaye serued in that chyrche / and had right grete temptacion of hys flesshe / but by cauhe doubted to angre our lord / he kepte hym fro synne / And prayd to the pope that he wold gyue hym leue for to marye / The pope considered hys symplenesse and for hys boūte he gaf hym a rynge in whych was an emerawde / and c that he •manded shold goo to thymage of saynt Agnes / whyche was in hys chyrche / and praye her that she wold be hys wyf / Thys symple man dyde so / And thymage put forth her fyngre / And he sette the rynge theron / And thenne she drewe her fyngre agayn and kept the ryng faste / And thenne anon all hys tempptacion carnall was quenchyd and take away from hym / And yet as it is said the rynge is on the fyngre of thymage / •sius dyde do make a grete fyre emong alle the peple / •hon the crysten peple myght surely come to the sepulcre vnhurte / ••yghtyst habytacion Constaunce the doughter of Constantyn was smeton wyth a sore and foul lepre / whan she had herd of the vysion of saynt agnes at her tombe sh And whan she was in

she awoke / and fonde her self perfyghtly hool / & anon she receyuyd baptesme and founded a chyrche vpon the body of the virgyne / And ther abode in her virgynyte / and assembled there many virgynes by cause of her good ensample / In an other place it is redde that whan the chyrche of saynt agnes was voyde / the pope said to a preest / that he wold gyue to hym a wyf for to norysshe and kepe / and he mente to cōmyse the chyrche of saynt agnes to hys cure / And he delyueryd to hym a rynge and bad hym to wedde thymage / And thymage put forth her fyngre / and he sette on it the ryng / and anon she closid the fynger to her hand and kept the rynge / and so espoused her / Of thys vyrgyne sayth saynt Ambrose in the book of vyrgynes / ¶ Thys vyrgyne / yong men / olde men / and chyldren preyse / ¶ Ther is none more to be praysed / than that may be praysed of all / Saynt Ambrose saith in hys preface that this blessyd saynt Agnes despysed the delytes of noblesse / and deserued heuenly dygnyte / she lefte the desires of mannes felawshyp / and she fonde the felawshyp of the euerlastyng kynge / And she receyuyng a precious deth for the confession of Ihesu cryst / is made conformable to hym /

the sepulcre of saynt agnes / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Agnes Here begynneth thynterpretacion of the name of saynt vyncent Vyncent is as moche to saye as brennyng vyces or ouercomyng brennynges / and kepyng victorye / For he brente and destroyed vyces by mortificacion of hys flessh / he vaynquysshid the brennyngis of tormentis by stedfast suffraunce / he helde the victorye of the world by despysyng of the same / he vaynquysshyd thre thynges in the world / that is to wete false errours / foule loues and wordly dredes / whyche thynges he ouercam / by wysedom / by clennesse / and by constaunce / Of whom saynt Austyn saith that the martirdoms of sayntes haue enseygned / that the world is ouercome wyth all errours / loues / and dredes / ¶ And som̄e afferme that saynt Austyn wrote and compyled hys passyon / whyche prudencien sette right clerly in versis / Of the lyf of saynt vyncent Vyncente was noble of lygnage / but he was more noble by fayth and relygion / And was deken to saynt valeryen bysshop / he was in hys chyldhode sette to studye / where by dyuyne prouydence he floured in double science / most parfoundly / that is to saye in dyuynyte and humanyte / To whom saynt valerien by cause he was empesshyd in hys tongue comysed to hym the fayttes and werkes of charge And hym self entended to prayer and contemplacion / And by the comandement of dacian the prouost vyncent and valeryen were drawen to valence / and there caste in pryson / And whan the prouost had supposed they had ben almost perysshyd for hungre and payne / he comanded them to come to fore hym / And whan he sawe them hool & Ioyeful / he beyng wroth began to crye moche / strongly and sayd / what saist thou valeryen whyche vnder the name of thy relygyon doost ayenst the decrees of prynces / And as the blessyd valeryen answerd lyghtly / Saynt vyncente sayd to hym / worshypful fader answere not hym so wyth a tymerous herte / but put out thy voys and escrye hym frely / And fader yf thou wylt comande me / I shal goo answere to the Iuge / To whom valerian said right dere sone it is longe sith I haue cōmysed to the / the charge of spekyng And now it byhoueth the to answere for the fayth / for whyche we ben here / Thenne saynt vyncent torned to the Iuge and said to dacyan / Thou hast holden vnto now / wordes to renye our faith / but knowe thou that it is grete felonnye to the wysedome of crysten men to blame and renye our crysten fayth / Thenne dacyan beyng wroth comāded that the bysshop shold be put in exile / And vyncente as a man presumptuous and despytons shold be put to be tormented in the place named eculeo / And it was made lyke a crosse twhart of whyche the two endes were fyxed in therthe / And that hys membres shold theron be broken for to fere the other / And whan he was all thus to broken / dacian said to hym / saye vyncente now seest thou thy body vnhappy / And vyncent smylyng sayd to hym / Thys is that I all way haue desired / Thēne the prouoste beyng wroth began to saye & menace hym with many turm̄tis / And vyncent said to hym / O vnhappy man how wenest thou to angre me / the more greuously that thou tormentest me / so moche more pyte shal god haue on me / Aryse vp thou vnhappy / man and cursid / and by thy wyckyd spyrite y u shalt be vaynquysshyd / For thou shalt me fynde more strenger by the vertue of god to suffre thy tormentis / than thou hast power to tormente me / Thenne the prouoste was angry / and began to crye / And the bochers toke scorgis and roddes & began to smyte and bete hym wyth roddes of yron / And saynt vyncent said / what saist thou dacyen / thou thy self auengest me of my tormentes / Thenne the prouost was wood & sayd to the bochers / ye wretches what doo ye why faylle and wexe faynt your hondes / ye haue ouercomen murdrers & aduoultrers / so that they coude hyde nothyng emong your tormentes / and thys vyncent only shal mowe surmoūt your tormentes / Thenne the bochyers toke combes of yron / and began to kembe hym on the sides within the flesshe / that the blood ran doun ouer all hys body / And that thentrayllis and guttes appiered by the Ioyntures of hys sides / And dacyen said to hym / vyncent haue pyte on thy self / in suche wise that y u mayst recouer thy fayr yongthe and wynne to spare the tormentes / that ben yet to come / And vyncente said to hym / O venymous tongue of the deuyll / I doubte nothyng thy tormentes / but I fere sore only / that thou wylt fayne to haue mercy on me / For so moche more as I see the angry / so moche more am I reioysed / I wyll tha and was brought vnto a torment of fyre / and he blamed and repreued the bochyers of their longe taryeng / Thenne wyth hys good wyll / he mounted vpon the gredyron and ther was rosted broylled and brente in all hys membres / and was styked wyth smal and pryckyd wyth brennyng poyntels of yron / And whan the blood ran in to the fyre / and made woundes vpon woundes / thenne they caste salt in to the fyre / that it shold sparkle and spryng in the woūdes of hys body / on alle partes of the woundes / that it shold more cruelle brenne and doo hym more payne on hys body / by the flammes / in suche wyse that the pryckys of yren myght not holde on hys membres / but on his entraylles whyche henge out of hys body / so that he myght not meue hym / And for all thys he was vnm prayd our lord Ihesu cryst wyth Ioyned hondes vp to heuen / And whā the mynystres had said thys to dacien he said / Alas we ben all vaynquysshyd / and he lyueth yet / And by cause he may yet lyue lenger / shet ye hym in a moche derke pryson / And gadre to gydre all the sharp shellis / & prycke them in hys feet / And late hym be stratched on thē wythout ony humayn comforte / And whan he shal be deed come and telle me / And thyes right cruel mynystres obeyed hym as to theyr lord right cruel / but the kyng for whō he suffred the payne so inhumayne / chaunged to hym all thys in to chaced away out of the pryson / by grete light And the sharpnes of the shelles were torned in to softnes and swetenes of alle maner flowres / hys feet were vnbounde / and he vsed the conforte of thonour of Angellis / And lyke as he had goon on the flowres syngyng wyth angellis / The swete soun of the songe and the swetnes and odour of the flowres whyche was merueyllous was smelled out of the pryson / And whan the kepers had seen thurgh the creuaces of the pryson / this that they sawe within / they were cōuerted / and torned to the faith / And whan dacyan herde this / he was wood & said / what shal we do to hym more / we ben ouercomen / Now thēne late hym be born in to a right softe bedde with softe clothes / so that he be not made more gloryous / and to the ende that he dye not yet / but that he be made strong agayn / and be kembid agayn / in newe tormentis And whan he was brought in a softe bedde / and had therin rested a whyle he rendred and gaf vp hys speryte vnto god in the yere of our lord CC lxxxviij / vnder dyoclesian and maximyen Emperours / And whan dacian herd saye that he was deed / he was moche sorouful / And sayd that in that wyse he was also vaynquysshyd / but sith I myght not ouercome hym lyuyng / I shal punysshe hym deed / And yf I may not haue victorye / I shal be fowled of the payne / Thenne the body of saynt vyncent was caste in a felde for to be deuoured of the bestes and fowles / by the comandement of dacian / but it was kepte wyth angellis / fro towchyng of ony beeste / And after cam a rauen whyche droof awaye all other byrdes and fowles / gretter than he was / and chaced away also a wulf wyth hys bylle and becke / and thenne torned hys heed toward the body / as he that meruaylled of the kepyng of thaungellis / And whan dacyen herd thys thyng / I trow sayd he that I may not surmounte hym whan he is deed / Thenne comanded he that he shold be caste in to the see wyth a myllne stone bounden to hys necke / to thende that he that myght not be destroyed vpon therthe of bestes / shold be deuoured in the see of belues and grete fysshes / Thenne the maronners that ladde the body in to the see / caste it therin / but the body was sonner arryued a londe / than the maronners were / And was founden of a lady and of som̄e other by the reuelacion of Ihesu cryst / And was honourably buryed of them / And saynt Austyn sayth of this holy blessyd martir saynt vyncent that he vaynquysshid so in wordes / he vaynquysshed in paynes / he vaynquysshed in confession / he vaynquysshyd in tribulacion / he ouercam the fyre / he ouercam the water / he vaynquysshyd deth / and vaynquysshyd lyf / Thys vyncent was tormented for to dwelle wyth god / he was scorgyd for to be introduced / he was beten for to be enstrengthed / he brente to be purged / he was gladder of the dredde of god than of the world he had leuer plese god than the world And had leuer deye to the world thā to god / Also saynt Austyn sayth in another place that a merueyllous thyng is sette to fore our eyen / that is a wyckyd Iuge a cruel

lawhed at thyse thyngis / and blamed the blody handes / by cause they put not the hokes and naylles depper in hys membres / And whan he was in the pryson / the Angele of god said to hym / Aryse vp

y e deuyl toke with hym fēdes that serued for fornycacion / & comāded them that they shold goo & enflāme the herte of that mayde in the loue of that yong mā / The whiche cam to her / & so

And therof shal ye answere atte day of dome / and the fader wepyng said / Alas wretchyd that I am / what is to me befallen / God haue mercy on my doughter / y t thus taketh away my tresour / and

Goo forth my doughter very kaytyf that thou art / & forth she wente & toke hym to her husbond / & they dwellid to gydre / The husbond wente not to chirche / ne be blessid hym not / ne recomended hym

had herd alle the caas how he had doon / she began to waylle and to wepe strongly / And forthwyth wente to saynt basylle / and reherced to hym all that she had herd of her husbond / And saynt basylle sente for the husbond and said to hym / my sone wylt thou reborne agayn to god / Syre sayd he / ye but I may not For I haue bounde my self to the deuyll and renyed Ihesu cryst / and therof I haue made a wrytyng of my hand and delyuerd it to hym / And saynt basylle sayd to hym / therof no force / Our lord is debonayr and mercyful / and shal receyue the yf thou repentest the / And anō toke the yong

accusyng me and sayeng / I cam to them / and not they to me / Thenne sayd basylle / my sone be not aferd / but put fermely thy byleue in Ihesu cryst / and saynt basylle gaf to hym a lytyl mete / for to comforte hym / and marked hym wyth the signe of the crosse / And closyd hym agayn / and he wente and prayd for hym / After certayn dayes passed he wente and vysited hym agayn / and askyd how it was with hym / And he answerd moche better than to fore / I here theyr clamours / and theyr menaces / but I see them not / Saynt basylle gaf hym mete / and closyd the dore and blessyd hym / and wente and

chyrche / And anon the deuyll wyth a grete multytude of fendes wythout sceyng of ony man toke the yong man and payned them to take hym out of the honde of saynt basylle / And the yong man bygan to crye / holy saynt of god helpe me And the fendes enforced them so gretly that they made saynt basylle to meue in holdyng the yong man / saynt basylle sayd / thou cursed & cruel fende / suffyseth not to the ynough thy { per } dicion propre / but thou must tēpte the creatures of my god for to haue them loste / The deuyl thēne said heryng many / O basyll thou greuest & ennoyest me moch / thēne all the peple cryed kyryeleyson / And saynt basylle said to y e deuyl / Our lord god blame & repreue the cursyd fende / And the deuyl said to hym / basylle thou greuest & anoyest me moche / I wēte not to hym / but he cam to me / he hath renyed hys god / & hath confessid me to be hys lord / lo here in my hond the wrytyng that he gaf to me / and saynt basylle said to hym we shal not cesse to pr said to the chyld / brother knowest thou answerd them I know thē well / For they were wreton with my honde / Thēne saynt basylle brake them / & ladde the chyld to the chyrche / & so or deyned & disposed hym y t he was worthy to receyue the holy sacrament / & after he beyng enseygned & taught delyuerd to hym a Rewle how he shold kepe hym / & delyuerd hym to hys wyf / Also ther was a woman that had cōmysed many synnes / the whyche she all wrote / And atte ende ther was one more greuous than the other / whyche in the wrytyng delyuerd to saynt basylle / prayeng hym to praye for her / And that by his prayers her synnes myght be foryeuen / and thēne he prayde for her & the woman opend the bylle / wherin she founde all the synnes deffaced & put out exept the greuous synne / And she cam to saynt basylle & sayd / thou holy saynt of god haue mercy on me / and gete me foryefnes for thys lyke as y u hast don for the other / And saynt basylle sayd to the woman / leue & goo fro me woman / For I am a man synnar as thou art whyche haue nede of pardon as moche as thou / And as she that was besy and greuous to hym he said to her goo vnto the holy man that is named effraym / and demaunde of hym that he may gete pardon for the / And whan she cam to the holy man Effraym / and had tolde to hym wherfor she was sente to hym fro saynt basylle / he sayd to her / goo fro me for I am a synful man / but goo agayn to saynt basylle / And it is he that may gete the foryefnes for thys synne / lyke as he dyde for the other And haste the to thēde / that thou maist fynde hym alyue / And whan she cam

anon she threwe the bylle vpon the coueryng of the byere / ¶ And anon after she toke it agayn and opend it and founde hyt alle playn and out clene of the bylle / ¶ And thenne wyth other she gaf thankynges to god ¶ To fore or saynt basylle deyde / he beyng in the maladye that he deyde / he dyde do come a Iewe to hym which was moche expert in physyke / And he louyd hym by cause he sawe that he shold be conuerted to the fayth / And whan he was come he felte hys puls / and sawe that he was nyghe hys ende / and sayd to hys meyney / Make ye redy suche thyng as byhoueth for hys sepulture / For he shal deye anon / whyche worde saynt basylle herd / and sayd to hym / thou woste not what thou sayest / And the Iewe named Ioseph sayd to hym / thys day shalt thou dye whan the sonne shal goo doun in the weste / To whom saynt basylle sayd / what shal thou saye yf I deye not t sayd / Syre it is not other wyse possyble / thenne sayd saynt basylle yf I lyue vnto the morowe none what shalt thou doo / And Ioseph sayde yf thou lyue vntyl the morow that houre / I shal deye / And saynt basylle sayd thou sayst trouthe / thou shal dye / that is synne shal dye in the to thēde that y u lyue in Ih̄u criste / & Ioseph said / I wote wel what y u saist and yf thou lyue vnto that tyme I shal doo that thou saist / Thēne saynt basille said how wel that by nature he shold haue deyde anon forthwith / yet he gate and Impetred of god space that he shold not thēne deye / & lyued vnto the morn at none / which thyng seyng Ioseph merueylled moche and byleued in Ihesu crist / Saynt basille thēne toke herte & ouercam the feblenes of the body / & aroos out of his bedde / & wente to y e chirche / and with his propre handes baptysed the Iewe / And after retorned to his bedde / & anon gaf vp his spirite & rendryd his sowle vnto god / aboute the yere of our lord iijClxx / Thenne lat •ye for hym vnto the tyme that thou shalt delyuer hys wrytyng / And thus as saynt basylle prayd holdyng the honde of the yong mā / the cedule whiche he had made was brought in thayer in the sight of alle / & was leyde in the honde of saynt basylle / the which receyued it / & •hyse lettres / & he •e Iuge bytwene me •ys day to whom Ioseph • vs praye to hym that he gete vs grace of our lord Ihesu cryst / that he wyll foryeue vs all our synnes / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Basille Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Iohan the Almosner SAynt Iohan the Almosner was patriack of Ih̄rlm / he sawe on a tyme in a vision a moche fair mayde which had on her hede a crowne of olyue / and whā he sawe her he was gretly abasshid & demaūded her what she was this maide answere to hym / I am mercy which brought fro heuē the sone of god yf thou wilt wedde me y u shalt fare the better / Thēne he vnderstandyng y t tholyue bit and he called alleway the poure peple his lordes Thēne he called his seruants & said to thē goo thurgh the cite & write ye all y e names of my lordes / and whan he sawe that they vnderstode not his wordes / he said to them / they ben they that ye calle poure & mēdiaūtes / I calle thē my lordes / and I saye they be my helpers / and trust it wel y t they mowe helpe & gete me the kyngdō of heuene / And by cause he wold styre the peple to do almesse he said that whan the poure men were ones to gydre wermyng thē ayenst the sonne / they begā to telle who were good almesmen / & thē wold they •keneth mercy / he begā that same day to be mercyful in suche wise that he was called almosner / or amener / •reyse / and blame them that werr euyll / emong all other he told this narracion / Ther was somtyme a tollar named peter / in a cite / & was a moche riche mā but he was not pyteous / but cruel to poure peple / For he wold hunte & chace away poure peple & beggars frō his hous with indignacion & angre / Thus wold no poure man come to hym for almesse / Thēne was there j poure man said to his felaws what wil ye gyue me yf I gete of hym an almesse this day / And they made a wager with hym that he shold not / which don he wente to this tollars hous / & stode at the yate & demanded almesse / And whan this riche man cam / and sawe this poure man at his yate / he was moche angry / and wold haue caste somwhat at his heed but he coude fynde nothyng / tyl atte last cam one of his seruants beryng a basket ful of brede of Rye / and in a grete angre he toke a rye loof & threwe it at his hede / as he that myght not here the crye of the poure man / and he toke vp the loof & ranne to his felaws / & sayd truly that he had receyued / that loof of petres owne hande / And thēne within ij dayes after this riche man was seke & lyke for to deye / And as he laye he was rauysshed in spirite / in whiche he sawe that he was sette in Iugement / & black men bryngyng forth hys wicked deedes / & leyde them in a balaūce on that one side / And on that other side / he sawe som̄e clothed in whyte mornyng and sorouful / but they had nothyng to leye ayenst them in that other balance / And one of them said / truly we haue nothyng god ayenst hys wylle but two dayes goon / ¶ And thenne they put that loof in to that balaunce And hym semed the balances were lyke euen / ¶ Thenne they sayd to hym / Encrece and multiplye this Rye loof / or ellis thou must be deueryd to thyse blac moores or fendes / And whan he awoke / he sayd alas / yf a Rey loof haue so moche auaylled me / whiche / yaf in despite / how moche shold it haue auaylled me / yf I had gyuen all my goodes to poure men with a good will / As this riche mā wente on a day clothed with his best clothis / a poure shipmā cam to hym all naked & demanded of hym som̄e clothyng / for y e loue of god to couere hym with all / and he anon dispoylled hym self & gaf to hym his riche clothyng that he ware / & anon the poure man solde it / & whan he knewe that the poure mā had solde it / he was so sory / that he wold ete no mete / but he said Alas I am not worthy that the poure mā thynk vpon me / and the nyght folowyng whā he slepte / he sawe one brighter than y e sonne hauyng a crosse on his hede weryng the same cloth that he had gyuē to the poure man / and he said to hym why wepest y u tol And whā he had told hym the cause of his sorow / he said to hym / knowest thou this cloth / And he said / ye sire / & thēne our lord said / I haue ben clothed therwith / sith thou gauyst it to me / And I thank the of thy good will that y u haddest pite of my nakidnesse / For whā I was a cold / thou couerdest me / And whan he awoke he blessid the poure peple & said / by the lyuyng god yf I lyue / I will be one of his poure mē / And whan he had gyuē all his good to poure men / he called one of his secrete men whō he trusted wel / & said to hym I haue a secrete coūseyl to telle the / & yf y u kepe it not secrete / & doo as I bydde the I shal selle the to the hethen men / And he toke hym x poūd in gold & had hym goo in to the holy cite & bye som̄e mercerye ware / And whā thou hast so don / take me & selle me to som̄e cristen man & take that money that thou shalt resscyue for me / & gyue it to poure peple And the seruaūt refused it / and he said truly yf thou selle me not / I shal selle y e to the barbaris / And thēne he toke this peter the tollenar as he had comanded hym / which was his maister clad in vyle clothyng & ledde hym to y e market & solde hym to an Argenter for xxx besaūtes / which he toke & delte it emong poure men / This peter thēne thus sold was boūde / & put in to a kychen for to doo all fowle werkes in suche wise that he was despised of euery man of the seruantes / And som̄e ofte smote hym & knocked hym aboute the head / & called hym fool / Criste appiered ofte to hym / & shewd hym hys clothyng and the besauntes and comforted hym / And themperour and other peple were sory for the losse of peter the tollenar / And it happed that noble mē of Constantynoble cam vnto the place where as peter was for to visite holy places whom the maister of peter had to dyner / And as they satte and ete at their dyner / peter serued and passed by thē and they beholdyng hym said to eche other in theyr erres how lyke is thys yongman to peter the tollenar / and as they wel sawe and aduysed hym / they sayd verely / it is my lord peter / I shal aryse and holde hym / And whan pieres vnderstode that / he fledde away pryuely / Ther was a porter / whyche was bothe deef and dombe / And by signes he opened the yates / And peter bad hym by wordes to opene the yate / And he anone herde hym and receyuyng speche answerd hym / And peter wente hys waye / And the porter retorned in to the hows spekyng and heeryng / wherof alle they meruaylled to whom he said he that was in the kychen is goon out and fleeth away / but knowe ye for certayn that he is the seruant of god / For as he spack and bad me opene the yate / ther yssued out of hys mouth a flamme of fyre whyche touchid my tongue and myn eeres / and anon I receyued heeryng and spekyng / And anone they alle wente out and ranne after hym / but they myght not fynde hym / Thenne alle they of the hows repented them and dyde pen had so foule entreated hym / Ther was a monke named vytale whiche wold assaye yf he myght reyse ony sklaundre ayenst saynt Ioh̄n / And saynt Ioh̄n cam in to a cyte and wente vnto alle the bordelles of comyn wymen / And said to eche of them by ordre gyue me thys nyght / and doo no fornycacion / Thenne he entred in to the hous of one / & was in a corner alle the nyght on hys knees in prayer and prayd for her / And on the morn he wente and comanded to eche of thē that they shold telle it to nomā / yet one of them manyfested hys lyf And anon as saynt Ioh̄n had prayd she began to be tormented with a deuyll And anon the other wymen said to her / god hath gyuen to the / that / that thou hast deserued / by cause she entred for to doo fornycacion / and not for none other cause / ¶ And whan it was euen the forsaid monke vytale said to fore them all / I wyll goo theder / For that woman abydeth me / thenne many blamed hym / And he answerd & said / am I not a man as another is I haue a body as other men haue / Is god only wroth wyth monkis / they be men as other be / Thenne som̄e of them said to hym / Take to the a wyf and chaūge thyn habite / so that thou sklaūdre not other / he faynyng hym self wroth said / veryly I shal not here you who that wyl be sklaundrd / late hym be sklaūdred and late hym smyte his forhede ayenst the walle / be ye ordeyned to be my Iuges of god / Goo ye and take heed of your self / For ye shal gyue none acomptes for me / And thys he said with a lowde voys / And then ne they complayned to saynt Ioh̄n of hys gouernaunce / Our lord harded so the herte that he gaf no credence to his wordes / but prayd god that he wold shewe hys werkes to som̄e creature after his deth / And that it sholde not torne hym to synne that defamed hym / by thys meane he brought many for to be conuerted / And sette of them many for to be closed in religyon / In a morenyng as he wente fro them / one of thyes comyn wymen mett wyth a man that entred in for to doo fornycacion / whom he gaf a buffette and sayd thou wycked man why amendest thou not thy wycked lyuyng / and he said to hym / byleue me right wel that thou shalt haue suche a buffet / that alle alysaūdre shal assemble to wondre on the / And after that the fende cam in lyknes of a man / and yaf hym a buffete and said to hym / thys is the buffet that thabbot vytale promysed the / and anon he was rauysshyd wyth the fende and tormented / so that all the peple drewe to hym and wondred on hym / but atte last he was repentaunt / And was heled by the prayers of saynt vytale / And whan the seruaunt of god was nygh hys ende / he lefte in wrytyng to hys dyscyples / Iugge ye neuer byfore the tyme / And whan he was deeed the wymen confessyd what he had don / And all they gloryfyed god / And namely saynt Ioh̄n sayeng / wold god that thy had taken / Ther was a poure man in thabyte of a pylgryme cam to saynt Ioh̄n and demanded almesse / And he callyd hys dyspenser and bad hym to gyue to that poure man vj pens / whyche he receyued and wente hys waye / and chaunged his clothyng / and cam agayn to the patriarke and asked almesse / And he callyd hys dyspenser / and bad hym to gyue hym vj pens of gold / And whan he had gyuen to hym and was departed / the dyspenser said to hys lord Fader at your request / thys man hath receyued twyes almesse thys day / and hath chaunged his habyte twies / saynt Ioh̄n fayned as he had not herd it / And the poure man chaunged his clothyng the thyrde tyme / and cam agayn to saynt Ioh̄n and asked yet the thyrd tyme almesse / And thenne the dyspenser told hys lord pryuely that he was the same beggar / to whom saynt Ioh̄n sayde / yeue to hym xij besaūtes / leste it be my lord Ihesu cryst that wyll preue me whether he myht more take / or I yeue / ¶ On a tyme it happed that one patricius had certayn money of the chyrche whyche he wold put in marchaundyse / but the patriarke wold in no wyse consente therto / but wold it shold be gyuen to poure peple / And they coude not acorde / but departed all wroth / And after euensong tyme the patryarke sente to tharchepreste patricius sayeng Syr the sonne is nygh goō doun / And he heryng that / anon he wepte and cam to hym and asked for yeuenes / ¶ On a tyme the neuew of the patryarke suffred wronge of a tauerner / And complayned lamentably to the patriarke and coude not be comforted / ¶ And the patriarke said to hym / who is so hardy that dar saye ayenst the / or opene hys mouth ayenst the / Byleue me sone that I shal thys day do for the suche a thyng that alle Alisaundre shal wondre on it / And And whan he herde that / he was wel conforted wenyng that the tauerner shold haue ben sore beten / And saynt Ioh̄n seeyng tha comforted / kyssed hys breste and said / Sone yf thou be veryly the neuew of myn humylyte / make the redy to be scorgid & to suffre of euery man betyngis / chydyngis and wronges / For veray affynyte is not only of flesshe and blood but it is knowe by the strengthe of vertue / And anone he sente for that mā and made hym free of alle pension and tribute / And all they that herd thys wondred gretly / And thenne vnderstode they that he had said byfore / that he wold so doo that all alysaūdre shold wondre therof / The patriarke herynge of the custome that is whan themperour is crowned / ther shal come to hym the makers of sepultures and brynge stones of marble of dyuerse colours / and demande themperour of what stones he wyl haue hys graue made or of what metalle / Saynt Ioh̄n remembryng thys comanded to make hys sepulture but yet he dyde not do make it alle / but lefte it vnparfyght vnto hys ende / And he ordeyned that at euery feste whan he was wyth the clergye / som̄e shold come to hym and saye / Syre thy monument or sepulture is not all made but Imperfyght / comande that it may be made / For thou wotest not what hour thou shalt dye / ne whan the theef cometh / ¶ There was a riche man whych sawe saynt Ioh̄n hauyng in his and not riche / For he had gyuen all hys good to poure men / he bought for hym a moche riche couertour for hys bedde / and yaue it to saynt Ioh̄n / And in a nyght as it laye vpon hym he coude not slepe / For he thoughte iijC of hys lordes myght wel haue be couerd wyth alle / and made all that nyght moche lamentacion seyeng / A lord how many ben there of my lordes now in the myre / how many in the rayn / how many so colde that theyr teeth beten to gydre / And how many that slepen in the market place / and sayd to hym self / and thou wretche deuourest the grete fysshes and restest in thy chambre wyth thy wickednesse vnder a couertour of xxvj pound to warme thy carayn / And after he wold neuer be couerd therwyth / but on the morn he dyde do selle it / & gaf the money therof to poure peple / And whan the ryche man sawe it / he bought it agayn / and toke it to the blessyd saynt Ioh̄n and desyred hym no more to selle it / but kepe it for hym self / And anon after saynt Ioh̄n solde it agayn / and gaf the money of hit to poure peple / And whan the riche mā wyst it / yet he bought it agayn and brought it to saynt Ioh̄n ful goodly & said to hym / we shal see who shal fayll of vs / or thou in the sellyng or I in the byeng / & thus it was ofte bought and solde / The riche man seeyng wel that he myght well mynusshe his richesse in this maner without synne to thentente to yeue it to poure peple / And they bothe shold wynne in thys maner / that one in sauyng of theyr soules / And that other in getyng reward / and saynt Ioh̄n wold drawe men to doo almesse / in thys maner / he was acustomed to telle of saynt serapion / whan he had gyue hys mantel to a poure man / And after mette wyth another that had colde / he gaf hym hys cote / And hym self satte al naked / And one demaunded of hym / Fader who hath despoylled the / And he had in hys honde the book of theuangelies / & said thys hath dyspoylled me / And anon he sawe another poure man / and thenne he solde the book of gospellis & gaf the prys therof to poure men / And whan he was demāded where hys book of the gospellis was / he answerd & said that the gospel comādeth and saith Goo and selle all that thou hast / and gyue it to the poure / I had thys gospell and I haue solde it / lyke as he comandeth / On a tyme he gaf to a poure man v besauntes / And the poure man had desdayn therof and began to chyde / and dyspyse hym in hys visage / by cause he had nomore almesse / And whan hys struantes sawe that / they wold haue beten hym / And thēne the blessyd Iohan deffended them sayeng / suffre ye hym brethern and late hym curse me / loo I haue thys lx yere blasphemed by my werkys Cryst / and may not I not bere one blame or vice of thys man / And he comanded that a sack of money full / shold be brought / to fore thys poure man that he shold take as moche as he world / On a tyme after that the gospell was redde in the chyrche the peple wente out and talked ydle tales / And thys holy patriarke apperceyued them / and folowed after and satte doun emong them / and said to them / Sones there as the sheep been / there must the sheepherde be also / And therfor eyther ye muste entre with me in to the chyrche / or ellys I must abyde wyth you here / And thus he dyde tweyes / And therby he taught the peple to abyde & stande in the chyrche / Another tyme ther was a yongman had rauysshed anonne / And the clerkys repreued the yong man therof to fore saynt Ioh̄n / And said he ought to be cursid therfor by cause he had lost ij sowles / his owne and the nonnes / Thenne saynt Iohan withstode theyr sentence sayeng / not so my sones not so / I shal shewe to you that ye cōmyse two synnes / Fyrst ye doo ayenst the comandement of god whyche saith Iuge ye not / and ye shal not be Iuged / Secondly ye wyte not for certayn whether they haue synned in to thys day / and haue not be penytent / and haue repented them It fyll many tymes that saynt Ioh̄n was rauysshyd in hys prayers and was in a traunce / And he was herd dyspute with our lord / in thyse wordes / So good lord Ihesu cryst so / I in partyng and thou in mynystryng / late vs see who shal ouercome / On a tyme whan he was seek & vexid wyth the feures and sawe that he approched hys ende / he said / I yelde to the thankynges / For thou hast herd my wretchidnes prayeng thy goodnes that at my deth shold be foūde wyth me but one besaunt / or one pece of money / and that yet I comande to be gyuen to the poure / And thenne he yelded hys soule vnto all myghty god / And his venerable body was put in a sepulcre where the bodyes of ij bysshoppis were buryed / And the two bodyes by myracle gaf rome and place to the body of saynt Ioh̄n / For they remeued eche fro other / and left the mydle voyde for his body / A lityl tyme to fore hys deth ther was a woman had cōmysed a grete and horryble synne / And durst not be shryuen therof ne bad here wryte hit and seale it / and brynge it to hym / And he wold praye for her / she assented therto / she wrote her synne / and dylygently closed and sealed it / And delyuerd it to saynt Ioh̄n / And anon after saynt Ioh̄n waxe seek and deyde And whan she herd that he was deed she supposed her self confused and shamed / For she wende that he hath delyuerd it to som̄e other man / and she cam to hys tombe / and there wepte & cryed moche lamentably sayeng / Alas Alas I supposed to haue eschewid my cōfusion / & now I am made confusion vnto all other / & wepte bytterly prayeng saynt Ioh̄n that he wold shewe to here where he had lefte her wrytyng / & And sodenly saynt Ioh̄n cam and appiered to her in thabyte of a bysshop / on eyther syde of hym a bysshop / and said to the woman / why troblest thou me so moche and thies sayntes wi and suffrest not vs to haue reste / loo here our clothes ben alle weet of thy teeris / And thenne delyuerd to her her scrowe agayn sealed as it was to fore sayeng to her / Se here thy seall / opene thy wrytyng and rede it / whyche anō she opened / and all her synne was disfaced and clene out / and she fonde therin wreton / Alle thy synne is foryeuen / and put away by the prayer of Ioh̄n my seruaunt / And thenne she rendred thākynges to our lord god and to saynt Ioh̄n / And thenne saynt Ioh̄n with the two bysshoppis retorned in to theyr sepulture / Thys holy man saynt Ioh̄n flowrid in the yere of our lord vjCv in the tyme of foke themperour / •ut a Rye loof which he gaf to •nar / •unce / by cause they •ke buffet that he toke / I • he was •edde but vyle clothes •hewe it to noman saynt Ioh̄n •h me Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Iohan the Almosner Of the conuersion of saynt paule & of the name of conuersion COnuersion is sayd of conuertor / I am torned / or is as moche as to gydre torned from synnes and euyllis / he is not conuerted that shryueth hym to y e preest of one synne and hydeth an other / It is said conuersion / For saynt paule thys day was conuerted to the fayth leuyng hys vices / why he is said paule / it shal be said afterward / ¶ Of the conuersion of saynt Paule THe conuersion of saynt Paule was made the same yere that cryste suffred hys passion / and saynt stephen was stoned also / not in the yere naturell but appieryng / For our lord suffred deth the viij kalendes of apryll And saynt stephen suffred deth the same yere the thyrde day of august / And was stoned and saynt paule was conuerted / the viij kalendis of feuerer / And thre reasons ben assigned wherfor the conuersion of saynt paule is halowed more than of other saynctes / Fyrst for thensample / by cause that no synnar what someuer he be shold despayre of pardon / whan he seeth hym that was in so grete synne / to be in so grete Ioye / Secondly for the Ioye / For lyke as the chyrche had grete so had she grete Ioye in his conuersion / Thyrdly for the myracle that our lord shewde / whan of j so cruel a persecutour was made so trewe a prechour / The conuersion of hym was merueyllous by reson of hym that made hym / and of hym that ordeyned hym / and of the pacient that suffred it / by reson of hym that made hym to be conuerted / that was Ihesu cryst / whyche shewde there his merueillous puyssaunce / in that he said / it is harde to the to stryue ayenst the alle or prycke / and in that / he chaunged hym so sodaynly / For anon as he was chaunged he said / lord what wylt y u that I doo / vpon thys word sayth saynt Austyn / the lambe slayn of the wulues / hath made of a wulf a lambe / For he was redy for to obeye / that to fore was wood for to persecute / Secondly he shewd hys merueyllous wysedom / hys merueyllous wysedom was in that / that he toke fro hym the swellyng of pryde / in offryng to hym the inward thynges of humylyte / and not the heyghte of mageste / For he said I am Ihesus of nazareth / And he called not hym self / god ne the sone of god / but he said to hym / take thynfirmytees of humanyte / and caste away the squames of pryde / Thyrdly he shewde hys pyteous debonayrte and mercy / whyche is signefied in that / that he that was in dede and in wylle to persecute / he conuerted / how be it he had euyl wyll / as he that desyred alle the menaces and thretenynges / & had euyll purpoos / as he that wente to the prynce of preestis / as he that had a Ioye in hys euyl werkis / that he ladde the crysten men bounden to Iherusalem / And therfor hys Iourneye and vyage was right euyll / And yet neuertheles the mercy of god conuerted / Secondly the conuersion was merueyllous of hym that ordeyned it that is of the lyght that he ordeyned in hys conuersion / And it is said that thys lyght was dispositif / sodayne / and celestyall / And thys light of heuen aduyronned hym sodeynly / Poule had in hym thre vices / the first was hardynesse / whych is noted whā it is said / that he wente to the prynce of the prestes / And as the glose sayth not called / but by hys owen wyll & enuye that enticed hym / The second was pryde / and that is signefyed by that he desired and sighed the menaces and thretenyngis / The thyrd was thentente carnall & the vnderstandyng that he had in the lawe / wherof the glose saith vpon that worde / I am Ih̄ūs & cetera / I god of heuene speke / the whyche thou supposest to be deed / by the consente of the Iewes / ¶ And thys lyght dyuyne was sodeyne / It was grete and out mesure for to throwe don̄ hym that was hye and proude in to the dyche or pytte of humanyte / It was celestyal / by cause it torned and chaūged hys flesshely vnderstondyng in to celestyall / Or it may be said that this ordenaunce or dysposicion was in thre thynges / that is to wete in the voys cryeng / in the light shynyng / and in the vertue of puyssaunce / Thyrdly it was merueyllous by the vertue of the souffryng of the pacyent that is of poule in whom the conuersion was made / For thyes thre thynges were made in hym without forth merueyllously / that is to wyte that he was beten to therthe / he was blynde / & fasted iij dayes & was smeton doun to the ground for to be reysed / & saynt austyn sayth he was smeton doun for to be blynde for to be chaunged and for to be sente / he was sente to suffre deth for trouthe / And yet saith saynt Austyn / he that was out of the fayth was hurte for to be made bileue / the persecutor was hurt to be made a prechour / the sone of perdicion was hurt / for to be made the vessell of election / And was made blynde for to be enlumyned / And thys was as touchyng hys derke vnderstandyng Thenne in the iij dayes that he abode thus blynde / he was lerned & enformed in the gospell / For he lerned it neuer of man ne by mā / as he hym self witnesseth but by the reuelacion of I And saynt Austyn sayth thus / I saye that seynt poule was the very champion of Ihesu cryst taught of hym redressed of hym / crucyfyed with hym / and gloryous in hym / he was made lene in hys flessh / that hys flessh shold be dysposid to theffecte of good operacion / And fro thenne forthon hys body was establyssed and desposed to all good / he coude wel suffre hungre / and habondaunce / and was informed and instructe in all thynges / And all aduersitees he gladly suffred / crisostom̄ sayth he ouercam tormentours / tyraūtes and peple full of woodnesse / lyke as flyes / And the deth / the tormentes / and all the paynes that myght be don to hym / he counted thē but as the p embraced wyth a good wyll / And he was ennobled in hym self to be bounde in a strōge chayne more than to be crowned with a crowne / And receyued more gladly strokes / and woundes than other yeftes / And it is red that in hym were thre thyngis / aynest the thre that were in our formest fader adam / for adam erected and adressid hym ayenst god our lord / And in saynt poule was contrarye / For he was throwē doun to the erthe / In adam was thopenyng of hys eyen / and poule was in the contrarye / made blynde / and adam ete of the fruyt deffended / And saynt poule contrarye was abstynent of cou •owe in hys persecucion / So ••su cryst / •aye of chyldren ¶ Alle them he •nable mete / Thus endeth the conuersion of saynt poule Here foloweth of saynt pawlyne the wydowe SAynt pawlyne was a moche noble wydowe of rome / of whome saynt Iherome wrote the lyf / and sayth fyrst thus / yf alle my membres were torned in to tongues / And alle my Arteryes shold resowne in humayne voys / yet I myght not worthyly wryte the vertues of saynt paulyne / I take wytnesse of god and of hys holy angellis / and also of thaungel that wa nothyng for preysyng / but tha good & puyssaunt of seygnorye at Rome / She was the most humble of all other / For lyke as the sonne surmounteth the clerenes of the sterres / so surmounted she the bounte of other by her grete humylyte / whan her husbond was passed out of thys world she abode lady of all the goodes and Rychesse / It happed that atte mandement of themperour many bysshoppis cam to Rome / emonge whom were there the holy man paulynus the patryarke of Anthyoche / And Epiphanus bysshop of cypre / of whom she was esprysed in good vertues so y t she gaf largely of her goodes for goddes sake / her parentes / ne her frendes / ne her owne chyldren / coude not torne her ne to make her to chaunge her purpose / but that she wold become the pilgryme of Ihesu cryst / For thamerous desyre that she had to Ihesu cryst surmoūted the loue that she had to her chyldren / Onely emong all her chyldren she had put her affectiō in eustochiū her doughter / whome she lad wyth her in thys pylgremage / She toke the see / and saylled so ferre that she cam in to the holy lande of Iherusalem / O how grete deuocion she had to vysyte the holy sepulcre / of Ihesu cryst / and the other holy places / and how all wepyng she kyssed them / ther can noman reherce alle / Alle the cyte of Iherusalem coude speke of it / And yet best of alle knewe the lorde / for whos loue she had forsaken all thynge / She had be at rome so puyssaunt and so noble / that euery man coueyted to doo to her honour / for her grete renōmee / but she that was foūded vpon humylyte sought the hūble places and relygions / and cam atte laste to bethleem / And whan she had deuoutly vysyted the place / in whych the vyrgyne marye enfaunted and childed Ihesu cryst she fyll in a vysion / And as she sware to me / that she sawe in that vision the chyld wrapped in poure clowtes lyeng in the cribbe or in the racke / and how the thre kynges worshipped hym / how the sterre cam vpon the hows / and how the shepherdes cam to see hym / and how herodes made persecucion vpon the Innocentis / and how Ioseph bare the chyld in to egypte / And thys vysion she said alle in wepyng and in lawhyng / and sayd I salewe the bethleem wherin he is born that descended fro heuen / Of the prophesyed mychee the xv chapytre / That of the shold be born the god that shold gouerne the peple of Israhel / And the lygnage of dauid shold endure in the / vnto the tyme that the gloryous virgyne shold enfaunte Iesu cryst / and I wretched as vnworthy to repute me to kysse the crybbe / in whyche our lord wepte as a chyld / and the vyrgyne chylded / here I shal take my reste and my dwellyng / For my sauyour chaas thys place in bethleem / She made there her habytacion wyth many vyrgynes that serued god / And how wel that she was lady of all / neuertheles she was the most humble and meke in spekyng in habyte / and in goyng / in suche wise that she semed seruant of all the other / She neuer ete after the deth of her husbond wyth noman / how good that he was / she vysited as it is sayd to fore all the holy places and the monkes of Egypte / emong whome were many of the auncyent fadres and many holy men / And her semed that she sawe Isesu cryst emong them / And after she founded in bethleem an abbaye in whyche she assembled virgynes / as wel of noble estate as of myddle and lowe lygnage / And departed them in thre congregacions / so that they were departed in werke / in mete and drynk but in sayeng theyr psaultier and adouryng were they to gydre atte houres as it apperteyned / And she enduced and enformed all the other in prayer & in werke by ensample gyuyng / She was neuer ydle / And alle And they had no shetes / ne lynnen cloth but to drye their handes / And they myght haue no lycence to speke to men / And them that cam late to the houres / she blamed debonayrly or sharply after that they were and suffred not that ony of them shold haue ony thyng saue the lyuyng and clothyng / for to put away auaryce / fro them / She appeased them swetely that stroof / And also she brake and mortyfyed emong the yong maydens / theyr flesshly desyres / by contynuel fastynges / For she had leuyr haue them good suffryng sorowe and sekenes / than their herte shold be hurte by flesshly wyll And she chastysed them that were nyce and queynte / sayeng that suche nycete was fylthe of the sowle / and said also / that a word sownyng to ony ordure or fylthe shold neuer yssue out of y e mouth of a virgyne / For by the wordes outward is shewd the countenaunce of y e herte within / and she that so spack and was rebuked therfor / yf she amended it not at the first warnyng / ne atte second / ne atte the thyrd / she shold be dysseueryd fro the other in etyng and in drynkyng / by whych she shold be asshamed / And thus shold be amended by debonayr correction / and yf she wold not / she shold be punysshyd by ryght grete moderaciō / She was merueyllous debonayr & pyteous / to them that were seke / and comforted them and serued them ryght besily / And gaf to thē largely to ete suche as they asked / but to her self she was hard in her sekenes & skarce / For she refused to ete flessh / how wel she gaf it to other / & also to drynke wyn / She was ofte by them that were seke / and leyde the pylowes a ryght & in poynt / And froted theyr feet / and chauffed water to wasshe them / And her semed that the lasse she dyde to the seke in seruyse / so moche lasse seruyse dyde she to god and deserued lasse meryte / And therfor she was to them pyetous / and nothyng to her self / In her right grete sekenesses she wold haue no softe bede / but laye vpon the str ground / and toke but lityl reste / For the most parte she was in prayers bothe by day and by nyght / & she wepte so moc semed of her eyen a fontayne / so And whan we sayd to her oftymes that she shold kepe her eyen fro wepyng so moche / she sayd the vysage ought to be lyke to be fowl / by cause it hath so moche be made fayr and gay ayenst the comandement of god / And the body ought to be chastised / that hath had so moche solas in thys world / & the lawhyngis ought to be recompensed by wepyngis / And the softe bedde and the shetis ought to be chaūgyd in to the sharpnes of hayer / I that was acustomed to pleyse man and the world / I desyre now to pleyse Ihesu cryst / And what shal I saye of chastete / in which she was example / vnto all ladyes of tyme passed / whan she was yet seculyer For she conuersed in suche wyse / that they that were enuyous durst not auyse on her ony euyl fame / she was debonayr and curtoys / vnto all / For she cōforted the poure / and warned the ryche / to doo wel / but in largesse she passed so / that n And thys dyde she not by the grete habundance that she had of goodes but by her wyse gouernaunce / and whan I said to her that she shold haue mesure in doyng almesse / after that the appostle sayth / that thalmesse that is doon to another / be not greuous to hym that doth it / But she said that for the loue of our lord she dyde all / And that she desyred to deye beggyng / in suche wyse that she shold not leue one peny to her doughter after her / And that she myght be wrapped in a strange shete whan she shold deye / And atte last she sayd / yf I shold demande ought / I shold fynde ynough that wold gyue to me / And thyes beggars yf I gaf to them nought / and they so departed and deyde for pouerte / Of whom shold god demaunde thys / Ofte sayd she se And almesse

her eyen to her etyng fysshe / ne mylke / egges or whyte mete / in whyche many wene to doo grete abstynence / without etyng flessh / For our lord gaf to her an aduersarye / the stymulacion flesshly / by which she held her in humylyte wythout sauouryng ony thyng of pryde for the foyson of her vertues / And also that she thought not to be heyer than other wymen / She had alleway in her mynde the holy scriptures ayenst the deceyuaunces of the frend / And specyally thys that moys saith / god assayeth you / yf he loue you / And this that ysaye sayth the prophete / ye that haue be atte solas and Ioyes of the world / and now be withdrawen fro them and lefte them / loke after none other thyng / but to suffre tribulacion vpon trybulacion / And knowe ye by tribulacion is had pacience / And by pacience is had pouerte / It is said Iob primo capl̄o / whan it was shewd to hym the losse of his patrymonye / he answerd I yssued nakyd fro the bely of my moder / And I shal reentre nakyd agayn in to therthe / lyke as god may be plesyd / so be it doon / hys name be preysed and blessyd / he lerned vs that we shold not loue the world / For the world shal fynysshe in her couetyse / whan one told her that her chyldren were right seke / she sayd / who loueth his sone or hys doughter more thā god is not worthy to be with god / A man that semed to be her frende / sente her word on a tyme / that she had grete nede to kepe wel her brayne / For by cause of thardeur that she had in vertues she semed to be out of her witte And she answerd / In thys world we be reputed as fooles for the loue of Ihesu cryst / And our lord said to his appostles / the world hateth you / For ye be not of the world / yf ye were of the world that is to saye of the conuersion of the world / the world shold loue you / Fayr lord god we mortyfye our self allewaye / and we be reputed as sheep that be brought to deth / by cau playnyng we mortefye our bodyes / In suche pacience was she vnto the deth / and suffred humbly thenuye of them that were euyll / She had in her mynde the holy scriptures / And she helde her more to the spyrituel vnderstondyng than to thystoryes of the scripture / She coude parfyghtly hebrewe / greke latyn & frensshe / and redde coursably the scriptures in thyse foure langages / who may recounte wythout wepyng the deeth of this woman / She fylle in a maladye mortall / and sawe wel that she shold deye / For all her body bycam cold / And she felte that her spirite helde her in her brest / Thenne said she wythout playnyng / and with out hauyng ony charge sauf to god / Fayr swete lord I haue coueyted the beaute of thy hous for to be in thyn habytacion / that is so fayr / My sowle hath desired to be in thy Royame / And whā I demaunded her wherfor she spack nomore / And she wold not answere me and I asked yf she suffred grete payne / she said to me in grekis tongue that she was wel and in good peas / And anone she lefte spekyng te me and closed her eyen in sayeng / to god / Lord lyke as the herte desireth to come to the fontayne / so desireth my sowle to come to the / Alas whan shal I come to the / fayr lord god / And in sayeng thyse wordes she made a crosse vpō her mouth

she rendred her sowle and passed out of thys world / And anone all the congregaciō of vyrgynes made no crye in wepyng as don y e peple of the world / but redde deuoutly their psaltier / not only vnto

themperour graunted them / And wrote that all men shold obeye them and helpe them vpon payne to lose their hedes / Now it happed that they edefyed a chirche / and all men by the comandement of themperour obeyed and heelp them ¶It happed that there were som̄e men that ladde a carte whyche shold passe by / and thought how they myght doo and passe without arestyng for to helpe them / they thoughte that one of thē shold lye on the carte / as he were deed And therby they wold excuse them / And so they dyde / and bad hym that laye in the carte to holde his eyen cloos tyl they were passed the paas / And whan they cam in the place where they edefyed the chyrche / Iulien and Iulie his broder sayd to them / my sones tarye a whyle and come helpe vs to werke / they answerd that they myght not For they caryed a dede man / Saynt Iulien said to them / why lye ye so / they answerd / Syre we lye not / it is soo as we saye to you / And saynt Iulyen sayd to them / so mote falle to you as ye saye / And anon they droof forth theyr oxen and passed forth And whan they were passed a lytyl / they called theyr felawe / that he shold aryse and dryue forth the oxen / for to goo the faster / And he answerd not one word And they called hym agayn on hye and sayd / art thou out of thy wytte / aryse vp and dryue forth the beestys / and he meued ne spack not one worde / They wente vp and dyscoueryd hym and fonde hym dede / as saynt Iulyen had sayd to them / Thenne toke they suche drede and fere that after that / they ne none otheer that herd of the myracle durste ly nomore to fore the holy seruaunt of god / Another Iulyen ther was that slewe hys fader and moder by ygnouraūce / And thys man was noble and yong and gladly wente for to hunte / And one tyme emonge all other he fonde an herte whyche retorned to ward hym / and said to hym / thou huntest me that shalt slee thy fader & moder / herof was he moche abasshed and aferd / And for drede that it shold not happen to hym / that the herte had sayd to hym / he wente pryuely away that noman knewe therof And fonde a prynce noble and grete / to whome he put hym in seruyse / And he preued so wel in bataylle / and in seruices in hys palays / that he was so moche in the prynces grace that he made hym knyght / And gaf to hym a ryche wydowe of a Castell / and for her doware he receyued the castell / And whan hys fader and moder knewe / that he was thus goon / they put hem in the waye for to seke hym in many places / And so longe they wente / tyl they cam to the castel where he dwelled / but thenne he was goon out / and they fonde hys wyf / And whan she sawe them she enquyred dylygently who they were / And whan they had sayd and recounted what was happend of theyr sone / she knewe veryly that they were the fader and moder of theyr husbonde / And receyuyd them moche charytably / And gaf to them her owne bedde / And made another for her self / And on the morn the wyf of Iulyen wente to the chyrche And her husbond come home whyles she was at chyrche / And entred in to hys chambre for to awake his wyf / And he sawe tweyne in his bedde / And had wende that it had ben a man that had leyen wyth his wif / And slewe them bothe wyth his swerd / ¶ And after wente out and sawe his wyf comyng fro chyrche Thenne he was moche abasshed / and demanded of his wyf who they were that laye in his bedde / thenne she said that they were hys fader and hys moder / whyche had longe sought hym / And she had leyed them in hys bedde / ¶ Thenne he swowned and was almost deed / And began to wepe bytterly and crye / Alas caytyf that I am

that I shal haue knwleche / yf god wylle pardone and foryeue me thys that I haue don and that I shal haue worthy penaunce therfore / And she answerd Ryght dere loue god forbede that ye shold goo wythout me / lyke as I haue had Ioye wyth you / so wyl I haue payne and heuynesse / Thenne departed they / and wente tyl they cam to a grete ryuer / ouer whyche moche folk passed / where they edeffyed an hospytall moche grete for to herberowe poure peple / And ther doo theyr penaunce / in beryng men ouer that wold passe / After longe tyme saynt Iulyen slepte aboute mydnyght sore traueylled and it was frozn / and moche colde / And he herd a voys lamentyng and cryeng that said / Iulien come / and helpe vs ouer / And anon he aroos and wente ouer and fonde one almost deed for colde / and anon he toke hym and bare hym to the fyre / and dyde grete laboure to chauffe and warme hym / And whan he sawe that he coude not be chaufed ne warme / he bare hym in to hys bedde / and couerd hym the best wyse he myght / And anon after he that was so seke and appiered as he had be meselle he sawe all shynyng assendyng in to heuen / and said to saynt Iulien hys hoost / Iulien oure lorde hath sente me to the / and sendeth the worde / that he hath accepted thy penaunce / And a whyle after seynt Iulien & hys wyf rendrid vnto god their soules & departed out of this world / Another Iulien ther was but he was no saynct / but a cursed man and was called Iulianus apostata / Thys Iulyen was first a monke / and shewyng out ward signes of grete religion and of grete holynesse / after that that mayster Iohan beleth reciteth / Ther was a woman that had thre pottes ful of gold And by cause the gold shold not be seyn / she had put in the mouth of the potte abouen asshes / And delyuerd them to thys Iulien to fore other monkes for to kepe / whom she reputed an holy man / but she said not to hym that they were ful of gold / whan he had thyse pottes he loked what was therin and he fond that it was gold / and toke it out all / And fylle them ful of asshes / And fledde wyth all to Rome / And dyde so moche that he was of the counceyllours and gouernours of Rome / But the woman whan she wold haue a gayn her pottes / she coude not preue that she had delyueryd to hym / in kepyng gold / For she made no mēcion therof to fore the monkes / And therfor he reteyned it / and procured wyth all thoffyce of a consul of the gouernaunce of Rome / And after that he procured somoche that he was instytued emperour / whylis he was yong he was taught in the arte of enchauntement and of thynuocacions of feendes / And gladly he studyed and it plesed hym moche / and had wyth hym dyuerse maystres of that science / Now it happed on a day that as hys maistre was oute / he began allone to rede thynuocacions / And a grete multitude of feendis cam aboute hym and made hym aferd / and he made the signe of the crosse and anon they vanysshed away / And whā his maistre was retorned he told hym what was happend to hym / but his maistre said to hym / y t alleway he had hated & fered that signe / whan thēne he was emperour / he remēbrid the rof / & by cause he wold vse the craft of deuyll / ouerall where he fonde y

that is called perside / And fro thens he sente in to thoccident / a deuyl for to haue answere of that he sayd to hym / And this deuyl wente / & abode x dayes in one place wythout meuyng by cause ther was a monke contynuelly in prayer nyght & day / And whan he myght not doo / he retorned / Thenne Iulien demanded hym / where he had ben so longe he answerd / I haue ben in a place where I fonde a monke nyght & daye prayeng / And I supposed to haue troubled hym that he shold nomore pray And all this whyle I coude neuer torne hym fro his prayer / And thus I am retorned wythout doyng ony thyng / Thenne Iulien thapostata had grete Indignacion / & sayd whan he cam thider / he wold auenge hym of the monke / And whan he wente in to perse / the deuylles promysed hym y t he shold haue victorye of a cyte / The maister of enchantemens whyche deuyned by the deuyl for hym said to a crysten man / what dooth the smythis sone / he said y t he made a sepulture for Iulyen his maistre / and as it is redde in thistorye of saynt basille / he cam in cesar And saynt basille cam ayenst hym / & presented thre louys to hym / whyche he sente to hym / And Iulien had grete Indygnacion of this yefte / And for the

awoke all affrayed / And wente to y e tombe where the knyght was buryed in / And opened the sepulcre / but he fonde neyther body ne Armes / Thenne he comanded of the kepar / who had take away the body And he sware that in the euen to fore it was there / Saynt basylle after on the morn retorned and fonde the body & the armures and the spere all blody / And anone cam one fro the bataylle / whyche sayd that Iulyen thapostata and Emperour was in the bataylle / And thyder cam a knyght vnknowen all armed wyth hys spere / whych hardyly smote hys hors wyth hys spores / and cam to Iulyen themperour and brandysshyd his swerd and smote hym thurgh the body and sodenly he departed / and was neuer after seen to gydres / And yel whan he shold dye / he toke hys hand ful of blood and caste it in to the

Ignace good disciple of Iesus & his especyal frende / the humble handmayd of Ih̄u cryst sendeth to the gretyng / I doo the to wete / that all that Ioh̄n hath sayd to the of Ihesu cryst / And all that

thappostle of the chirche of Anthyoche / And moche desired to be a martir for y e faith of Ihesu crist / It happed that Traian whych was emperour of Rome passyd by Anthioche / To whom Ignace shewed to hym & blamed of thys that he persecuted crysten men / wherfor themperour dyde hym to be taken and put in yrons / And in that wyse by x knyghtes to be ladde to Rome / There he was presented to fore themperour / and alle the senatours of Rome / And was constrayned by promesses / by menaces / And by tormentis many grete / and horryble / for to adoure thydolles / Saynt Ignace shewd to them clerely y t theyr goddes had ben theuys / Rybauldes / and men of abhomynable & euyl lyf / And that they were dampned in helle / And that they had ben in grete errour in thys / that of so cursid men they made theyr goddes / and worshypped deuyllys / and had forsake god whyche had made and created all the world / And hys blessyd sone whyche in humayne nature had redemyd and sauyd the world / Fynably after thys that he had be tormented by fyre & by betyng / & pryson / Themperour dyde sende for the romayns in a place and there dyde do sette saynt Ignace / And dydde doo brynge theder two lyons for to deuoure hym / but he had neuer drede for deth ne for other tormentes / of whyche he had suffred many / but was alleway cōforted for to deye for the loue of Ih̄u crist / and he said atte laste / I am wheete of Ihesu cryst whyche ought to be groūden bytwene the teeth of thyse bestes / by whych I may be pure brede / for to be presented to my lord / And anon the lyons cā & strangled hym / wythout treryng of hys flessh or ony thyng hurtyng it / wherfor traian had grete merueylle and departed fro the place / It is redde that saynt Ignace in alle hys tormentes / and alle the paynes of martirdom that he suffred / that his tongue neuer ceassed to name the name of Ih̄us / And whan they that tormented hym demanded hym wherfor he named this name so ofte / he answerd knowe ye for certayn that I haue in my herte thys name wreton And therfor I may not leue to name thys name ofte And by cause herof whan he was deed / they that herd thyse wordes opened hys body & drewe out his herte & cut it

Qui habitat / Saynt Ignace martir of god gloryous is of grete meryte / whyche was mynystre to the dyscyple that Ihesus so moche louyd / And in hys epystles / the whyche he sente to the gloryous

whyche by the offryng is signefyed / The douue whiche is of her nature symple / & wyhout galle / And the turtle naturelly chaste / ¶ For whan she hath loste her make / she wyl neuer haue other make / And wyth that she taketh the wepyng for her songe / we ought to offre to our lord in stede of ij douues one symple wyll and a good Intencion / wythout reteynyng in our herte ony galle of angre or of hate / toward our neyhbour / For as our lord sayth / yf thyn eye be symple / all thy werkes shal be in light / ¶ And herof sayth saynt Iohan theuangelist in thapocalipse / The cyte nedeth no sonne ne mone to shyne in it / For the clerenes of god shal enlumyne it / And hys lanterne in lambes / The lambe is the lyght / by the lambe whyche is symple / is signefyed to vs a symple conscience and

turtles to our lord / that is to saye a chast lyf / and a very entenciō to leue our synnes / the whiche is signefyed to vs by the chasttete of the turtle / ¶ And by her wepyng / the contricion / As Bede saith Contricion ought to begynne in drede / and ende in loue / For the sowle faithful / whan she remembreth her synnes in her conscience / ¶ She wepeth for the drede of the paynes of helle / that she hath deseruyd / and thus offreth she to god a turtle / And whan she hath wepte / ther cometh to her an hope to haue mercy and pardon of her synnes / And thys hope conceyued of drede in hym a loue of god to serue and to be in hys companye / So that that soule / that ought to synge wepeth for loue / whyche hath delyuerd her so sone fro the paryllis and myseryes of thys world and for to come to the swete companye of our lord / And thus offreth she that other turtle in wepyng wyth dauid the prophete the longe pylgremage / that she hath made in the myseryes of thys world sayeng / Heu me quia incolatus meus prolongatus est / For whan she begynneth to thynke after the Ioyous companye of Angellis / and of the sowles that ben in heuene / And what Ioye and deduyt that they haue in the

for to shewe to vs thexample of humylite / he is very humble that is worthy to be praysed for hys vertues / Thys gloryous lady is quene of heuene and lady of angellis / neuerthebes she is pure and

ledyng a pure and holy lyf / Quyncyen the prouost of Secyle beyng of a lowe lygnage was lecherous / Auaricious and a mes And for taccōplysshe hys euyl desyris flesshly and to haue richesses / dyde do take saynt Agathe to be presented and brought to fore hym / And began to beholde her wyth a lecherous sight / And for to haue her hym self / he wold haue enduced her to make sacrefyse vnto the ydolles

make the to deye by dyuerse tormentis / Saynt Aghate abode ferme and stable in the fayth / Theenne quyncianus dyde doo put her in a derke pryson / And she wente also gladly and with as good wyll as she had ben prayd to goon to a weddyng / On the morn quyncianus made her to be brought to fore hym in Iugement / And said to her / Agathe how art thou aduysed for thy helth / She answerd cryst is myn helthe / Quyncianus said renye cryst thy god / by whyche thou mayst escape thy tormentis / Saynt Agathe answerd / Nay / but renye y u thyn ydolles whyche ben of stones and of wood / And adoure thy maker that made heuene and erthe / And yf thou doo not / thou shalt be tormented in the perpetuell fyre in helle / Thenne in grete yre quyncianus dyde her to be drawē and stratched on a tree and tormented and sayd to her / Refuse thy vayne opnyon that thou hast / and thou shalt be eas of thy payne / •ed and she answerd I haue as grete dilection in thyse paynes / as he that sawe come to hym that thyng whyche he most coueyteth to see / or as he that had founde grete tresour / And lyke as the whete may not be put in the garner vnto the tyme / y t the chaff be beten of / in lyke wyse my-sowle may not entre in to the Royame of heuene / but yf thou wel tormente my body by thy mynystres / Thenne quyncianus dyde her to be tormentid in her brestes and pappes / and comanded that her brestis and mamellis shold be drawē & cutte of / whan y e mynystres had accomplysshid his comandement / Thenne saynt Agathe said / Ouer felon and cruelle tyraunt hast thou noo shame to cutte of that

And sawe how I myght well hele them / Thenne said she / I knewe neuer of medecyne corporall / And it were shame to me to take it now / That whyche I haue auowed and kept to my lord sith myn Infancye /

I thanke the fayr fader that thou art so dylygent to hele me / but knowe that my body shal receyue no medecyne of noman / And thys noble man saide wherfore suffrest thou not me / that I maye hele and

restored to her / and all her woundes heled / And all that nyght was the pryson fulfyllyd wyth grete clerenes and lyght / so that the kepers fledde / for the grete drede that they had / and lefte the pryson all open / Thenne said to her the other prysoners that were in the pryson / that she shold goo theyr waye / And she sayd that shal neuer happen that the kepars of the prison shal suffre ony harme for me / ne that I shal lose my crowne / I shal abyde / in the fayth of Ihesu cryst / my lord whyche hath comforted and heled me / After foure dayes quyncianus made her to be brought to fore hym

thynterpretacion of hys name AMande is as moche to saye as amyalle / For he had in hym thre thynges / that make a man amyable / The first is to be courtoys and gracious in companye / As salamon sayth in his prouerbes the xix chapitre / Vir amabilis ad societatem / The second is to be honest / in conuersacion / as it is sayd of hester / hester secundo / Quod omnibus oculis amabilis videlatur / The thyrde is to be vertuons in fayth of prowesse as it is sayd in the book of paralipomenon / the second chapytre / Saul & Ionathas amabiles et decori / Of the lyf of saynt amande SAynt amand was born of noble fader and moder / On a tyme he entred in to a monastery / And as he walked and wente in the chyrch he fonde a grete serpente / whom by the vertue of hys prayer and wyth the signe of the crosse he made hym to yssue out / And to entree in to the grete pytte out of whyche he neuer yssued after / And after saynt amande cam to the sepulcre of saynt martyn / and there abode xv yere / where he lyued wyth barle brede and water / and ware alleway the hayer / After that / he wente to rome And wente in to the chyrche of saynt peter / and abode there by nyght / the kepar of the chyrche put hym out right rudely / And saynt peter appyered to hym as he laye and slepte to fore the chyrche dore / And sente hym in legacion in to fraunce / where he fonde the kyng dagobert / the whyche he repreued strongly of hys synnes / The kynge was angry and put hym out of hys Royame / After whan the kynge had no sone / he made hys prayer to god that he myght haue one / And god sente hym one / And whan he was born / he thought moche & sorowed who shold baptise hym / And it cam vnto his mynde that he wold that saynt Amande shold baptyse hym / Saynt amāde was sought and brought to the kyng / and assone as he was come the kynge fyl doun to hys feet / and prayd hym that he wold pardone hym of that he had trespaced to hym / And that he wold baptyse hys sone / And saynt amande graunted benyngly to the

mocqued hys wordes / The feend toke hym and with hys owen treth he tare hym / and confessid that he had don Iniurye to the persone of god and anon deyd myserably / Now it happed on a tyme that he weesshe hys handes / and a bysshop made the water to be kepte / of whych water a blynde man had hys sight agayn / It happed that in that place by the wyll of the kyng he wold edeffye a monasterye / of monkes / thenne a bysshop that was of the next cyte toke it greuously and was moche angry therwith / and comanded hys seruantes to caste hym out / or ellis they shold slee hym / And anon they came to

Sayyt valentyne answerd hym / yf thou haddest very knowleche of the grace of Ihesu cryst / thou sholdest not saye thys that thou sayest / but sholdest renye thydolles / and worshyppe veray god Thēne sayd to saynt valentyn a prynce Thenne said to saynt valentyn a prynce whiche was of the coūceylle of themperour / what wylt thou saye of our goddes and of theyr holy lyf / And saynt valentyn answerd / I saye none other thyng of them but that they were men mortall and meschaunt / and full of all ordure and euyll / Thenne sayd claudius themperour / yf Ihesu cryst be god veryly / wherfor saist not

thynterpretacion of her name IUliane is as moche to saye as brennyng playnly / for she brente her self / ayenst the tēptaciō of the deuyll which wold haue deceyued her And she helped many other to byleue in the fayth of our lord Ihesu cryst ¶ Of saynt Iuliane SAynt Iuliane was gyuen in maryage to the prouoste of Nychomede whyche was named Elongius / And he was a paynem / And therfor she wold not assente to the maryage ne assemble wyth hym / but yf he wold first take the fayth of cryst and be baptysed / whan her fader sawe this Anone he dyde do her to be naked and made her to be beten sore / And after delyuerd her to the prouost / And after whan the prouoste helde her / and sawe the grete beaute in her / he sayd to her / my most swete Iulyane why hast thou brought me in suche cōfusion

sayd Fayr lady that may I not doo / For themperour shold thenne smyte of my heed / And she sayd / yf thou doubtest so moche themperour whyche is mortal / why shold not I doubte myn emperour Ilesu cryst whyche is inmortal doo what thou wylt / For thou maist not deceyue me / Thēne the prouoste dyde her to be bete / most cruelly wyth Roddes / And half adaye to hange by the heeris of her heed / and molten leed to be caste on her heed And whan he sawe that all thys greued her not / he made her to be bounden in chaynes / and to be sette in pryson / To whome the deuylle cam thenne in the lyknes of an Angele / which said to her in thys manere / Iulyane I am the angele of god whyche hath sente me to the to warne and saye that thou make sacrefise to thydolles for teskape the tormentis of euyl

a voys that sayd / that she shold sette honde on hym / and that she constrayne hym to confesse what he was / ¶ And anon she toke hym / and demanded hym / And he said that he was the deuyll / ¶ And that hys fader had sente hym theder for to deceyue her / She demaunded hym who is thy fader / ¶ And he answerd beelzebub / whyche sendeth vs for to doo all euyll / And maketh vs greuously to be beten whan we comen vaynquysshyd of the crysten peple / And therfor I am certayn I shal haue moche harme by cause I may not ouercome the / ¶ She sayd to hym of what craft is thy fader belzebub / the deuyll sayde / he contryueth all euyl & whan we come in to helle / he sendeth vs for to tempte the sowles of the peple / She demaunded what tormentis suffreth he / that cometh vaynquysshid of a crysten creature / the deuyl sayd we suffre thenne moche grieuous torment / ¶ And by cause whan we be vaynquysshyd of a good man we dar not retorne / and whan we be sought and can not be founden / thenne comādeth our maystre to other deuylles that they tormente vs where som̄e euer they fynde vs / ¶ And t And of what craft art thou / I take solace in the shrewdnes of the peple / I loue homycyde

right grete harme and euyl am I come hether / For I had wel supposed to haue deceyued the / and made the to make sacrefise to thydolles / and to renounse thy god / whan we come to a good crysten man / and we fynde hym redy to doo seruyse to god we sende in hym many thoughtes vayne and euyll / and also many euyl desires / and torne hys thought by thys that we sette to fore hym / and we sende errours in hys thougtes / And we lete hym not perseuere in hys orysons ne in noo good werkes / yet yf we see ony that wyl goo to the chyrche or in other place for ony good anon we ben in theyr wayes and caste in theyr hertes dyuerse thoughtes and occasions by whyche they be dystorned for to do wel / But who someuer may vnderstonde our temptacions and apperteyne them / to thende that he put away fro hym the euyl cogytacions & thoughtes / and wylle make hys prayers and do hys good werkis / and here the wordes of god and the dyuyne seruyse / Of hym we be cast out / And whan they receyue the body of Ihesu cryst we departe forthwyth fro them / we sette our entente to nothyng but to deceyue good persones / that lede an holy lyf / and whan we see them doo good werkes / we sende in them bytter and greuous thoughtes for to leue alle / and doo our wylle / Seynt Iulyane sayd / O thou esperyte how art thou so hardy to tempte ony crysten persone / And the deuyl answerd / how darst thou thus holde me / yf it were not thou affyest in Ihesu cryst / ryght so trust I in my fader / whyche is a malefactour / and I doo that plesith hym / I haue payned me to doo oft many euylles / And somtyme I come to myn entente & accōplyssh my desire / but at this tyme I haue failled / I wold I had not comen hyther / Alas how vnderstode my fader / of this that shold not happe Madame late me goo & gyue me leue to goo in to som̄e other place / for it is no nede that I accuse the to my fader / Atte laste she lete hym goo / •erfore we must obeye to hym as to our fader / On the morn the prouost comāded that saynt Iulian shold be brought to fore hym in Iugement And whan he sawe her so wel guarisshed and her vysage so fayr / and so shynyng / thenne said the prouoste to her Iulyane who hath taught the and how mayst thou vaynquyssh the tormentis / And she sayd herkene to me / and I shal saye to the My lord Ihesu cryst hath taught me to adoure the fader the sone and the holy ghoost / For I haue ouercomen and vaynquysshyd Sathanas thy fader / and alle hys other deuyllis / For god hath sente hys Angell for to conforte me and to helpe me / Meschaunt man knowest thou not / that the tormentis ben made redy fore the euerlastyng / where thou shal be tormentid perpetuelly in a perpetuel derkenes and obscurete / Anon the prouoste made to be brought a whele of yron bytwene two pylers and iiij horses to draw it forth And foure knyghtes at one side and foure knyghtes on that other to drawe and foure for to drawe forth the whele so that alle the body was tobroken / in suche wyse that the mary cam out of the bones / And the wheel was al blody / Thenne cam an angel of god and brake the wheel / and heled the wondes of saynt Iulyane and heled perfaytly / And for thys myracle were conuertid alle they that were present / And anon after for the fayth of Ihesu cryst / were byheded men and wymen to the nomof Cxxx personnes / After comanded the prouost / that she shold be put in a grete potte ful of boyllyng leed / And whan she entryd in to the sayd potte / Alle the leed bycam cold / so that she felte none harme / ¶ And the prouoste cursid hys goddes / / by cause they myght not punyssh a mayde that so vaynquysshyd them / And thenne he comāded to smyte of her heed And whan she was ledde to be byheded the deuyl appyered to the prouoste in figure of a yong man and sayde / Spare not good peple / and of her haue no mercy / For she hath blamed your goddes / And don moche harme / ¶ And me she hath beten thys nyght passed / Therfore rendre to her that she hath deseruyd / Wyth thyes wordes saynt Iuliane loked behynde her for to wyte who sayd suche wordes of her / ¶ Anone the deuyl sayd / Alas / Alas Caytyf that I am I doubte me / that yet she wylle take and bynde me / ¶ And so he vanysshyd away / After thys that she had admonested the peple to loue and serue Ihesu cryst / she prayd them alle to praye for her / And thenne her heed was smeton of / The prouoste entred in to a shyppe wyth xxxiiij men for to passe an Arme of the see / Anon cam a grete orage and a tempest / which drowned the prouost and alle hys cōpanye in the see / ¶ And the see threwe theyr bodyes to the Ryuage / And wylde beestes cam thyder and ete them / Thus thys holy vygyne saynt Iulane suffryd martirdom for our lord the xiiij kalendes of the moneth of marche / late vs praye to her that she praye for vs & c̄ / Thus endeth the lyf and passion of saynt Iulian virgyne Of thee chayeryng of saynt Peter thappostle THe chayer is sayd in thre maners / that is the chayer Ryall as it is said in the boke of kynges / Dauid sittyng in a chayer / And ther is a chayer of prestes as regum prymo / Hely the preeste syttyng vpon a chayer / And the thyrde is the chayer for a Mayster / as is sayd / Mathei xxiij / vpon the chayer of moyses et cetera / Thenne saynt peter satte in a chayer ryall / For he was prynce of thappostles And he satte in the chayer of prestes / For he was lord of alle the prestes / And in the chayer of the maystre / For he was a grete doctour of crysten men / The first was of equyte / The seconde of quātyte / And the thirde of trouthe and of vertue / HOly chyrche haloweth the feste of saynt petre thappostle / & this day was seynt petre honourably enhaūced in y e cite of anthioche / & sette in the chaier as a bysshop / Many causes ther ben / wherfore thys feste is halowed and establysshyd / Of whom the first is as is sayd in a sermon of thys feste / that whan saynt peter wente for to preche the word of god / and founded holy chyrche by hys predycacion / Niceta & Aquila shewed vnto the cyte of Anthioche / that peter thappostle of god cam theder / wherfore the peple / And also the nobles of the cyte / cam ayenst hym And knowleched them self culpable / of that they had holden of the predicacion of Symon magus / whyche was an enchaunteur / ¶ After they dyde to be brought to fore hym all suche people as were vexid wyth dyuerse maladyes and sekenesses / of whom there were so many that they myght not be nombred / ¶ Saynt peter behelde theyr repentaunce / ¶ And also that they byleuyd fermly in the name of god / And anon lyft vp hys handes vnto heuen and made hys prayr to god sayeng / ¶ O god fader almyghty I yelde to the thankynges / in thys that thou hast worthyly fulfyllyd the promesses of thy blessyd sone by whyche alle creatures may knowe that thou art one onely god in heuen and in erthe / And after he ascended vp in to an hye place / And alle the multytude of sekemen were brought to fore hym / And said to them in thys manere / ye that see me a mortal man as ye be / wene ne suppose not ye / that by me ye may be heled / but by hym that is descended fro heuene to therthe / whyche gyueth to alle them that byleue in hym full helthe of body and of soule / thys ought ye to byleue / to thende that alle may knowe that ye y t thus byleue entierly wyth all your herte in Ihesu cryst may and guarisshid by hym / & anone all they y t were seke cried with an hie vois / we byleue that Ih̄u crist is veray god / sodenly a light appierid there / And alle the seke peple were guarysshed and beled / of what someuer maladye they had / And that same day the holy ghoost shewde so gretely hys grace / that fro the leste vnto the moste / Alle byleued in our lord Ihesu cryst / ¶ And there were baptised in vij dayes more than ten thousand persones of men wymen and chyldren / ¶ And also theophilus the lord and prouost of the cyte / to whom seynt peter had reysed his sone / whyche had ben xiiij yere deed / And som̄e saye that of hys palays he made a chyrche / in the whyche alle the peple sette vp a chayer for saynt peter to sytte in more hyer for to preche the doctryne of Ihesu cryste / and the better to be herd and seen / And of thexaltyng thus of saynt peter in to thys chayer / thys feste taketh the name of the chayeryng of saynt peter / And in thys chyrche was saynt peter vij yere And fro thens he wente to Rome / and gouerned the chirche of Rome xxv yere / ¶ That other reason why thys feste was establysshed was for the reuerence of the crowne or tonsure on hys heed / whyche yet clerkes bere and haue / ¶ For lyke as som̄e saye / at this Iourneye was first founde the crowne of the clerkes / For whan saynt peter prechyd atte fyrst tyme in the cyte of anthioche / the paynems share hym vpon hys heed aboue lyke a fool in despysyng crysten lawe / And by cause thys was don to saynt Peter / For to doo hym despyte and shame / it was syth / stablysshyd that the clergye shold haue hys crowne shauen / in signe of right grete honour and auctoryte / And it is to wete that in the crowne ben thre thyngis / Fyrst the heed is dyscouerd and bare aboue / and the heer cut away / And the crowne is rounde / Ther ben thre resons why the heed is bare / of whyche saynt denys assygneth the tweyne / and sayth the rasure and cuttyng of / of the heer signefyeth pure lyf and clene wythout ony arayeng wythout forth / For lyke as heeris ben naturelly for to aourne the heed / right so dysforme they the heed whan they be cut of by mocquery or other wyse / Also good maners whych ought to aourne the clene lyf / defforme the holy conuersacion whan they ben left & takē away by habites couoytous and proude / Also the rasure or shauyng whyche is on the ouermest parte of the heed / signefieth that bytwene god & them / ought be nethyng ne mene that shold dysplese god / but their loue shold be in god wythout ony lettyng & enpesshement / And shold adresse in hem theyr thoughtes / The second thyng that is in the crowne is that the heeris bey shaue clene away / by that is signefied that the clerkes ought to take away fro their hertes all vayne thoughtes / whiche myght lette & enpesshe the seruyse dyuyne / & also ought to be with drawen frō all tēporall besynesse / sauf only to haue their necessitees / The third thyng that is in the crowne / is that it is r good by many resons / The first it that a roūde figure hath neyther begynnyng ne ende / The second is in a round crowne bē no corners / And as saynt bernard saith where as ben corners / there is gladly filth / and that is to be vnderstonde / that the clerkes ought not to haue in their hertes no corners where y e filthe of synnes myght assemble / but ought to haue a clene conscience / And also they ought to haue trouthe in their mouthes For as sayth saynt Iherome / trouthe seketh no corners / The thirde reason is For lyke as the figure of a crowne / is most fayre emong all other / So the conuersacion of clerkes or prestes ought to be best aourned of good maners emong all other laye peple / The fourth reson is / for lyke as a crowne hath but one way rounde and no fygure / lyke as saynt Austyn sayth / ther is none so symple a fygure as that whyche hath but one way / Also the clerkes ought to be symple in theyr conuersacion wyth out fiction / and pryde / And it is to wite that holy chyrche haloweth of saynt peter iij festes in the yere for thre yeftes / that he hath power to gyue to the peple / The first is the chayer For he gyueth absolucion of synnes / The second feste is called aduincula / that is the first day of August / Fur he by hys power transumeth the payne perpetuell due for synnes mortall in to payne temporell / The thyrde feste is of hys martyrdom / For he hath power to relece sōme paynes of penaunce enioyned for the synnes confessyd / And for thyse thre causes / he is dygne and worthy honourably to be serued and worshypped / Late vs thenne praye to hym / that he may Impetre and gete to vs remyssyon of alle our synnes / and after thys short transitorye lyf we may come to euerlastyng Ioye and glorye in heuen / 〈◊〉 made hool •unde / and this figure semeth Amen Thus endeth the Chayeryng of saynt Peter Of saynt Mathye thappostle / & fyrst thynterpretacion of hys name MAthias in hebrewe is as moch to saie as gyuen to our lord / or a gift of our lord / or ellis hūble or lityl / For he was gyuen of our lord / whan he was chosen fro the world / and was sette and entred emong the lxxij dyscyples / he was also gyuen of our lord / whan he was chosen by lotte & nombred emong thappostles / he was lityl / For he had all veray mekenes / in hym & humylite ¶ Ther be iij maners of humylitees as saynt Ambrose saith that the first is of the affliction by whyche aman is made humble / The second is consideraciō of of hym self / & the third is of y t deuocion which is of the knowleche of his maker / Saynt mathye had the first in suffryng martirdom / The second was in despysyng hym self / and he had the third in amerueyllyng the mageste of our lord / For mathye is said / as doyng good for euyl / For he beyng good was sette in the place of Iudas the traytre / And hys lyf is redde in holy chyrche and bede wryteth it as many holy men wytnesse / ¶Of saynt mathye SAynt mathye thappostle was in the place of Iudas the traytre / And therfore first we shal reherce here the birthe and begynnyng of Iudas It is redde in an hystorye thaugh it it be named apocripha that ther was a man in Iherusalem named r and by another name Symeon of the kynred of dauid / or after saynt Iherome of the trybe of ysachar whyche had a wyf named Ciborea / and on the nyght that Iudas was conceyued hys moder had a merueyllous dreme wherof she was so sore aferd / For her semed that she had conceyued a chyld that shold destroye their peple / and by cause of the losse of alle theyr peple / her husbond blamed her moche and sayd to her thou sayst a thyng ouer euylle / or the deuylles wyl deceyue the / She sayd certaynly yf so be that I shal haue a sone / I trowe it shal be so as I haue had a reuelacion and none illusion / whan the chyld was born the fader and moder were in grete doubte / and thoughte what was beste to doo / ¶ For they durst not slee the chyld For thorrour that they shold haue therin / neyther they wyst not how they myght nourysshe one that shold destroye theyr lygnage / Thenne they put hym to a lytyl fyscelle or baskette wel pytched & sette it the in see And abandonned hym to dryue whyther it wold / ¶ And anon the floodes and wal and made hym aryue in an ylonde named Scaryoth / ¶ And of thys name was he callyd Iudas Scaryoth / Now it happed that the quene of this contree wente for to playe on the ryuage of the see / And byheld thys lytyl nacelle and the chyld / therin whyche was fayr / And thenne she syghed and sayd / ¶ O lord god how shold I be eased yf I had suche a chyld / Thenne atte leste shold not my Royame be wythoute heyre / Thenne comanded she that the chyld shold be taken vp and be nourysshid and she fayned her self to be grete with chyld / And after publysshyd that she had born a fayr sone / whan her husbond herd saye herof / he had grete Ioye / and all the peple of the contre made grete feste / ¶ The kynge and quene dyde do norysshe and kepe thys chylde lyke the sone of a kynge / Anon after it happed that the quene conceyued a sone / And whan it was born and growen Iudas bete ofte that chylde / For he wende that he had ben hys broder and ofte he was chastysed therfore / but allewaye he made hym to wepe so longe that the quene / whyche knew wel that Iudas was not her sone / And atte laste she sayd the trouthe / and tolde how that Iudas was founden in the see / and yet this er was knowen Iudas slewe the chylde that he had supposed to be hys brother and was sone to the kynge / And in eschewyng the sentence of deth / he fledde anon and cam in to Iherusalem / And entred in to the court of pylate whyche tho was prouoste / And he so plesid hym that he was grete with hym and had in grete chyerete / and nothyng was doon wythout hym / Now it happed on a day that pylate wente for to dysporte hym by a gardyn / bylongyng to the fader of Iudas / And was so desirous to ete of the fruyt of thapp And the fader of Iudas knewe not Iudas hys sone / For he had supposed that he had be drowned in the see longe to fore ne the sone knewe not the fader / whan pylate had told to Iudas of hys desyre he sprange in to the gardyn of hys fader / and gadred of the fruyt for to bere And ther bygan bytwene them moche stryf and debate fyrst by wordes / and after wyth fyghtyng so moche that Iudas smote hys fader wyth a stone on the heed / that he slewe hym / ¶ And after brought thapples vnto pylate / And tolde to hym how that he had slayn hym that ought the gardyn / Thenne sente pylate to sease all the good that the fader of Iudas had / And after gaf hys wyf to Iudas in mariage / And thus Iudas wedded hys owen moder / Now it happed on a day that the lady wepte & sighed moche strongly & said / alas how vnhappy that I am / I haue lost my sone & my husbond / My sone was leyd on the see and I suppose that he be drowned and my husbond is dede sodeynly / And yet it is more greuous to me that pylate hath remaryed me ayenst my wyll Thenne demaūded Iudas of thys child And she told hym how he was sette in the see / And Iudas tolde to her how he had be foūden in the see / in suche wise y t she wist that she was his moder / & that he had slayn hys fader / & wedded hys moder / wherfor thēne he wente to Ihesu cryst which dyde so many myracles / & prayd hym of mercy & forgifnes of his synnes / Thus fer it is red in thistorye which is not autentike / Our lord made Iudas one of his appostles & reteyned hym in his cōpanye / and was so pryue with hym / that he was made his procuratour & bare the purse for all the other / and stale of that whiche was gyuen to cryst / Thenne it happed that he was sory and angry / for thoygne mēt that Marye magdalene poured on the heed and feet of our lord Ihesu crist & sayd that it was worth CCC pens and sayd that so moche he had lost / And therfor sold he Ihesu cryst for xxx pens of y e money vsual / of whiche euery peny was worth x pens / And so he recouuerd CCC pens / Or after that som̄e saye / that he ought to haue of all the yeftes that was gyuen to Ihesu cryst the tenthe peny / And so he recouerd xxx pens of that he sold hym And neuerthheles atte leste he brought them agayn to the temple and after henge hym self in despayr / And hys body opened and clefte a sonder / and hys bowellis fylle out / And so it apperteyned wel that it shold so be / for y e mouth whyche god had kyssyd ought not to be defouled in touchyng / & also he ought not to dye on the erthe / by cause all erthely creatures ought to hate hym / but in the ayer where deuyllys and wyckyd spyrites had deseruyd to be in theyr companye / Thenne whan the tyme cam bytwene thascencion / and wythsontyde saynt peter byheld that the nombre of thappostles was menusshyd / he aroos vp in the myddle of the dyscyples / and said fair brethern / ye knowe how our lord Ihesu cryst hadde chosen xij men for to bere wytnesse of hys resurrection / And Iudas was goon the euyl waye / It behoueth taccomplysshe the nombre of xij / of suche as hath ben wyth hym / And sith they chosen two of them that were there / that one was named Ioseph surnamed Iustus / and that other was mathye / And thenne they made their orysons & said / lord god whyche knowest the hertes of all the persones / Shewe to vs whome we shal chese of thyes tweyne here / And after they caste lottes / and the lotte fylle on mathye / whyche forth wyth was enombred wyth the other xj / And thenne were they xij / But the holy saynt denys sayth that the lotte was a Raye and a shynyng whyche cam and shone vpon hym / And anon he bygan to preche / and had hys predycacion aboute Iherusalem / And was moche vertuous and dyde many myracles as is wreton of hym of whom the legende foloweth / whyche legende is founde at Tryre in Almayne / •ben / •es of the see brought •lles that he myght not forbere them / •o hys maystre / but the fader of Iudas deffended hym / •ee / by cause he SAynt mathye whyche was sette in the place of Iudas / was born in bethleem of the trybe of Iuda / he was sette to scole and in a lytyl tyme he lerned all the science of the lawe and of the prophetes / he was a ferd of flesshly lustes / And he passyd hys yongthe in good maners / hys corage was enclyned to all vertues / ¶ For he was humble and debonayr / and allewaye redy vnto do mercy / And was not proud in prosperite / ne fraylle in aduersytee / he dyde that / whyche he prechid he made the blynde to see and heled the seke men / he reysed the dede men / and dide grete myracles in the name of Ihesu cryste / And whan he was accused herof to fore the bysshop of Iherusalem / it was demaunded hym that he shold answere therto / And he sayd / It behoueth not moche tanswere herto / by cause for to be a crysten man it is nothyng crymynel / but it is a gloryous lyf Thenne sayd the bysshop that he wold spare hym and gyue hym respyte to repente hym / And saynt Mathye answerd god forbede that I shold repente of the trouthe that I haue truly founden and become an apostate / He was ferme in the loue of god & clene of hys body / and wyse in spekyng to alle the questions of scripture / And whan he prechyd the word of god / many byleuyd in Ihesu cryst by hys predicacion / The Iewes toke hym And brougt hym to Iustyce / and had goten two false wytnesses ayenst hym and for taccuse hym / the whyche caste on hym fyrst stones / and the other after / and so was stoned / And he prayd that the stones myght be buryed that the false wytnessys had cast vpon hym / For to bere wytnesse agayn thē that stoned hym / And fynably he was slayn wyth an axe after the maner of the Romayns / And he held vp hys handes / and comaunded hys esperyte to god / And after is is sayd that hys body was brought to Rome / And fro rome it was translated vnto t and buryed vnder a stone of pourphyrye in the chyrche of saynt marye the maior / •yre Another legende sayth that hys hody lyeth at Rome / ¶Of saynt Gregorye the pope GRegorye is sayd of grex whyche is to saye a flock / & of gere whych is to saye a prechour / Thenne Gregorye is to saye as a prechour / to an assemble or flock of peple / or it is said as a noble doctour / or prechour / Or gregorye is to saye in our langage as awaked / For the awoke to hym self to god / and to the peple / he awoke to hym self by kepyng of clennesse / to god by good contemplacion / And to the peple by contynuel predycacion / And by thys is deserued the vision of god / And saynt Austyn sayth in the book of ordre / that he seeth god / that wel lyueth / wel studyeth and wel prayeth / And poul thystoryograph of the lombardes wryteth his hystorye and lyf of hym / the whyche Ioh̄n the dekene afterward moche dylygently compyled and ordeyned / SAynt Gregorye was born of the parentele of senatoures of Rome whos fader was named Gordyane / and hys moder siluia / And whan he had so moche lerned that he was a maystre / in phylosophye and also was ryche of patrymonye / he thoughte that he wold leue all the rychesses that he had and wold entre in to religyon for to serue god / but in thys that he put thys thought in respyte / he conseyued another purpoos / that was that hym semed he shold better serue god in a seculer habyte / in dooyng thoffyce of the pretorye of the prouost of R god / In thys mene whyle hys fader and moder deyden / in suche wyse that he was ryche of patrymonye and puyssaunt / that atte begynnyng he founded and endowed wyth rentes vj abbeyes in zecylle / And the seuenth he founded wythin the walles of Rome / in thonour of saynt Andrew thappostle / in the whyche he becam a monke / And the remanaunt of his patrymonye he gaf for goddes sake / So that he that to fore wente clothed in clothes of gold and of silke / and aourned wyth precious stones in the cyte / whan he was monke seruyd in a poure habyte the monkes / There was atte begynnyng of hys conuersacion / of so parfayt a lyf / that it myght be sayd wel that he was all parfayt / he made grete abstynences in etyng / in drynkyng / in wakyng / and in prayeng in so moche / that he was so trauaylled that vnnethe he myght susteyne hym self / he had put out of hys herte alle seculier thynges / so that hys conuersacion was in heuen / For he had adressid alle hys desyre for to come to the Ioye permanable / On a tyme it happed that saynt gregorye in hys selle of the same abbaye / where as he was abbote wrote somme thyng / And an Angele appered to hym in semblaunce of a maronner whyche semed as he had escaped fro the tempest of the see / And prayd hym wepyng to haue pyte on hym Thenne saynt gregorye comanded that ther shold be gyuen to hym vj pens / And thenne he departed / The same day the angele cam agyan in lyke wyse as he dyde to fore / And sayd that he had lost all hys good and prayd hym that he wold yet helpe hym / on whō saynt gregorye had yet pyte / and dyde do be gyuen to hym vj pens more / yet atte thyrde tyme he cam and made grete crye and wepte / and prayd hym that he wold yet helpe hym to ward hys grete losse / so that saynt gregorye comanded hys prouoste that he shold yet gyue to thys poure man an almesse / And the prouoste sayd / that ther was nomore siluer in all thabbaye but a disshe of siluer in whyche hys moder was wonte to sende hym potage / And saynt gregorye comanded anon that / that dysshe of siluer shold be gyuen to hym / And the angele toke it wyth grete Ioye / And lytyl whyle after thys angele appyeryd to saynt gregorye and sayd to hym that god hath sente hym so to hym / It happed afterward that as saynt gregory passed thurgh the market of Rome / and sawe there two fair chyldren whyt and rody of vysage / & fayr yelow heer / whiche were for to selle And saynt gregory demaunded fro whens they were / And the marchaūt answerd of englond / After saynt gregory demaunded yf they were crysten and he answerd nay / but that they were paynems / Thenne sight saynt gregorye and sayd Alas / what fayr peple hath the deuyl in hys doctryne and in hys domynacion / After he demaunded how thyse peple were called / he answerd that they were called englyssh men / thenne he said they may well be so called / for they haue the vysage of angelles / And for that saynt gregory wente to the pope / And by grete prayers he Impetred and had graūte that he was sente in to englond for to conuerte the peple of the same contre / but whā the Romayns herd saye that gregorye was sent in to englond / Anon they wente to the pope and sayd to hym / Thou hast angred saynt peter / thou hast destroyed al Rome / And hurte all holy chyrche / in this that thou hast lete gregorye goon out of Rome / Of whyche word the pope was angry and moche abasshed / And sente anone his messagers after saynt gregory / And comanded hym to retorne / and come agayn to Rome / whyche thenne was goon on hys Iourney / thre dayes / and for hys noble and good renomee the pope made hym cardynal deken / After for the corrupcion of thayer the pope pelagius deyed / And thenne saynt gregorye was electe / of alle the paple to be pope / but he refused it and sayd / that to that dygnyte he was not worthy / And for the ryght grete mortalyte er that he was sacred pope he made to the peple a sermon and said / Ryght dere brethern wel ought we to haue doubte of the scorge of god er that we fele it / And yet we ought to fere it & to torne and forsake our synnes / loo ye may beholde the peple deye er they bywepe theyr synnes / Thynk ye thenne in what poynt he cometh in the presence of the Iuge / that hath had no tyme to bewaylle hys synnes / The howses ben voyde / the chyldren deye in the presence of fader and moder sodaynly so that they haue lytyl tyme to deye / wher fore euery man amende hys lyf / whylis he hath tyme for to repente hym of hys euyl dedes and synnes / er that the Iuge calle hym / fro the mortal body / he sayth by the prophete / I wylle not the deth of a synnar / but I wyl that he retorne and lyue / moche soone the Iuge hereth the synnar whan he conuerteth fro hys synnes and amendeth hys lyf / By suche manere admonested he to the peple theyr helthe / And he or deyned to make processyon in alle the chyrches moche solempnly for to impetre and gete mercy for thys mortalyte / whan the processyon was doon / he wold haue goon pryuely out of Rome for thescewe thoffyce of the papalyte / but ayenst that / the gates were kepte so that he myght not yssue / Atte laste he dyde do chaunge hys habyte / And so moche dyde wyth the marchaunts / that they brought hym out of Rome in a tonne vpon a carte / And whan he was ferre out of the toun / he yssued out of the tonne / and hydde hym in a dyche / And whan he had ben therin iij dayes the peple of Rome sought hym all aboute / Anone they sawe a pyler shynyng descende fro heuen strayt vpon the dyche / in whyche saynt gregorye was / And a recluse an holy man sawe that by that pyler angellis descended fro heuen to saynt gregory / and after wente vp agayn / Anone thenne saynt gregory was taken of the peple / and after thordynaunce of holy chyrche he was ordeyned and sacred pope ayenst hys wyll / For he was moche debonayr / humble and mercyful to riche and poure and to grete and smale / wel may he apperceyue / that redeth his wrytynges / how ofte he complayned of thys grete charge that he was charged wyth alle / to whyche he sayd he was not worthy therto / and also he myght not here that ony shold preyse hym ne in lettres ne in wordes / And alleway he was in grete humylite / and acounted hym self more meke and lowe after that he was pope than to fore in so moche that he was the first of the popes that wrote seruus seruorum dei / that is seruaūt of the seruantis of god he had grete cure and was besy to conuerte synnars / he made and compyled many fayr bookes / of whyche the chirche is gretly enlumyned / he was neuer ydle / how wel that he was alleway seke / he conuerteth the englisshe peple to the crysten fayth by thre holy men and good clerkys that he sente thyder / that is to wyte Augustyn / mellitus / and Ioh̄n / for to preche the fayth / And by cause the mortalyte cessyd not he ordeyned a procession / in the whyche he dyde do bere an ymage of our lady / which as is sayd saynt luke the euangelyste made / whyche was a good payntour / he had coruen it & paynted after the lykenesse of the gloryouse virgyne marye And anon the mortalyte cessed / and thayer becam pure and clere / And aboute thymage was herd a voys of angellis that songen thys Antheme regina celi letare & c̄ / And saynt gregory put therto / Ora pro nobis deum alleluya / At the same tyme saynt gregory sawe an angele vpon a Castelle / whyche made clene a swerd alle blody and put it in to the shethe / And therby saynt gregory vnderstode that the pestylence of thys mortalite was passed / and after that / it was called the castell Angell / Saynt gregory dyde euery day so grete almesse / that many in the contre aboute were nourisshid by hym / whom he had by name wreton / And also the monkes that dwellyd in the mount Synay had of hym theyr sustenaunce / Emonge alle other almesses that he dyde / he gouerned thre thousand virgyns / to whom he sente euery yere four score pound of gold / and also he founded to them an abbeye in Iherusalem / ¶ And sente to them that therin were suche thynge as they lacked / Euery day had he poure men to dyner / On a tyme it happed that he toke the lauour for to gyue water to a pylgrym for to wasshe hys hondes by grete humylite / and anon the pylgrym vanysshyd a way / wherof saynt gregory had merueylle / The nyght after our lord appiered in a vysion and said to hym / The other dayes thou hast receyued me in my membres / but yesterday thou receyuedest me in my persone / Another day saynt gregory comaunded to hys dyspenser that he shold brynge to dyner xij poure men / And whan saynt gregory and the poure men were sette atte mete / he tolde atte table syttyng xiij poure pylgryms / And demaunded of hys dyspenser why he had don aboue hys comandement / to brynge in moo than xij persones / And anon the dyspenser all abasshyd wente and told the poure men and fonde but xij / and sayd to saynt gregory / holy fader ther be no moo but xij / and so many shal ye fynd and nomoo / Thenne considerid saynt gregorye that one of the pylgryms that sette next to hym ofte chaunged hys vysage / For ofte he semed yong / and after old / And after dyner saynt gregory toke hym by the honde and brought hym in to hys chambre / and prayd hym that he wold telle hym hys name / And he answerd wherfor demādest thou my name which is merueyllous / neuertheles knowe thou wel that I am the same poure maronner / to whom thou gauest the dyssh of siluer in which thy moder was wonte to sente the potage / And knowe for certayn that sith that day / that thou dydyst to me that almesse / god hath destyned the / to be pope / And sayd more ouer / I am thangelle of god / and he hath sente me hyther to the to be thy deffendour / & procurour / of that whiche thou woldest demande and Impetre of hym / And after this the angele vanysshed away / And in that tyme ther was an heremyte an holy man whyche had lefte and forsaken all the goodes of the world for goddes sake / and had reteyned nothyng but a catte / wyth whyche he playde ofte / and helde it in hys lappe delyciously / On a day it happed that he prayd god deuoutly that he wold wouch had left all the world and renounced / vpon thys god shewd hym in a vysion that saynt gregory and he shold haue lyke Ioye in heuene / And whan he vnder stode thys he syghed sore / and preysid lytyl hys pouerte whyche he had longe suffred and born / yf he shold haue lyke meryte whyche habounded so gretly in seculer Rychesse / vpon this ther cam a voys to hym whyche said / that the possession of richesse maketh not a man in this world riche / but the ardour of couetyse / Thenne be stille thou / darest thou compare thy pouerte to the rychesse of saynt gregory / whyche louest more thy catte with whom thou cessest not to stroke and playe / than saynt gregory doth all his richesses / for he seesseth neuer to gyue almesse for goddes sake / Thenne theremyte thanked almyghty god and prayd that he myght haue hys meryte and reward with saynt gregory in the glorye of peradys / On a day it happed that saynt gregory sange masse in the chyrche of saynt Marye Maior / And whan he had said / Pax dominj sit semper vobiscum / Anone thangele sayd / Et cum spiritu tuo / and fro than forthon the pope ordeyned a stacion in that chyrche euery yere on ester day / And whan thenne he sayd in hys masse / Pax dominj & c̄ / none shal answere in remembraunce of this myracle / In the tyme that Traian themperour regned / & one as a tyme he wēte toward abatayll out of Rome / it happed that in his way as he shold ryde a woman a wydowe cam to hym wepyng and sayd / I pray the sire that thou auēge the deth of one my sone / whiche Innocently and wythout cause hath be slayn / Themperour answerd / yf I come agayn fro the bataylle hool and sounde / thenne I shal doo Iustyce for the deth of thy sone / Thenne said the wydowe / Syre / and yf thou deye in the bataylle / who shal thenne auenge his deth / And themperour sayde / he that shal come after me / And the wydowe sayd / is it not better that thou do to me Iustyce / and haue the meryte therof of god / than another haue it for the / Thenne had traian pyte / and descended fro hys hors / and dyde Iustice in auengyng the deth of her sone / On a tyme saynt gregory wente by the market of Rome / whyche is called the market of traian / And thene he remembred of the Iustice and other good dedes of traian / and how he had ben pyteous and debonayr / and was moche sorowful that he had ben a paynem / And he torned to the chyrche of saynt peter wayllyng for thorrour of the mescreaunce of traian / Thenne answerd a voys fro god / sayeng I haue now herd thy prayer / and haue spared traian fro the payne perpetuell / By thys thus as som̄e saye / the payne perpetuel due to traian as a mescreaunt was somdele take away / but for al that was not he quyte fro the pryson of helle / For the sowle may wel be in helle / and fele ther no payne by the mercy of god / And after it is sayd that the angele in hys answere sayd more to thus / by cause thou hast prayd for a payneme / god graunteth the to chese of ij thynges that one which thou wylt / Or thou shalt be ij dayes in purgatorye in payne / or ellis all the dayes of thy lyf thou shalt languysshe in sekenesse / Thenne answerd saynt gregory / that he had leuer to haue sekenesse all his lyf in this world / than to fele by ij dayes the paynes of purgatorye / And euer after he had contynuelly the feures or axces / or the goute in hys feet / And herof hym self maketh mencion in one hys epystle and sayth / I am so moche tormented of the gowte in my feet and of other sekenesses / that my lif is to me a grete payne euery day me semeth that I ought to deye / And alleway I abyde the deth / Som̄e tyme my payne is lityl / & somtyme right grete / but it is not so lityl / that it departeth fro me / ne so grete y t it bryngeth me to deth / And thus it is that I that am alleway redy to deye / am withdrawen fro deth / It happed that a wydowe that was wonte euery sonday to brynge hoostes to synge masse wyth / shold on a tyme be houselyd & cōmuned / And whan saynt gregory shold gyue to her the holy sacrament / in sayeng / Corpus dominj nostrj & c̄ / that is to saye / the body of our lord Ih̄u cryst / kepe the in to euerlastyng lyf / Anone thys woman began to smyle to fore saynt gregorye / And anon he wythdrewe hys honde / and remysed the sacrament vpon thaulter / And he demaunded her to fore the peple why she smyled / And she sayd by cause y t the brede that I haue made with my propre handes / thou namest it the body of our lord Ihesu cryst / Anone saynt gregory put hym self to prayer wyth the peple / For to praye to god that herupō he wold shewe hys grace for to conferme our byleue / And whan they were rysen fro prayer / saynt gregorye sawe the holy sacrament in figure of a pyece of fhessh as grete as the lytil fynger of an honde / And anone after by the prayers of saynt gregorye / the flesshe of the sacrament torned in to semblaūce of breed / as it had be to fore / And therwyth he comuned and howseled the woman / whiche after was more relygyous and the peple more ferme in the fayth / Saynt gregorye made and ordeyned the songe of thoffyce of holy chirche / and establysshed at Rome two scoles of songe / that one beside the chyrche of saynt peter / And that other by the chyrche of saynt Ioh̄n latian / where the place is yet where he laye and taughte the scoliers / and the rodde wyth whiche he menaced them / And the anthyphoner / on whyche he lerned them is yet there / he put to the canon of the masse thse wordes / Dies { que } nostros in tua pace disponamus / at { que } ab eterna dampnacione nos eripias / et in electorum tuorum iubeas grege numerari / Atte laste whan saynt gregory had ben pope xiij yere / vj monethis / and x dayes / he beyng ful of good werkes departed out of thys world in the yere of our lord vjCvj yere in the tyme whan foca was Emperour of rome / Lete vs thēne praye to saynt gregory / that he gete vs grace that we may amende so our self here in thys lif that we may come vnto euerlastyng lyf in heuen / Amen •me / ¶ For to gyue to eche man duely reson after the right of hys cause / but he fonde in this office so grete seculer besynesse / that it began to dysplese hym / by cause by thys grete besynesse / he wythdrewe hym ouer for fro • • sauf to shewe to hym to what saynt he shold be in lyke Ioye in heuen / by cause for his loue he Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Gregorye Here begynneth of saynt longius the lyf LOngius whyche was a puyssaūt knyght was wyth other knyghtes by the comandement of pylate on the side of the crosse of our lord and percyd the side of our lord wyth a spere / And whan he sawe the myracles / how the sonne lost his light / and grete erthequauyng of therthe was / whan our lord suffred deth and passion in the tre of the crosse / Thenne byleued he in Ihesu cryst / Som̄e saye that whan he smote our lord wyth the spere in the syde / the precious blood aualed by the shafte of the spere vpon hys hondes / And of auenture wyth hys hondes he touched hys eyen / And anon he that had be to fore blynde sawe anon clerly / wherfor he refused all cheualrye / and abode wyth thappostles / of whom he was taught and crystened and after he abandonned to lede an holy lyf / in doyng almesses and in kepyng the lyf of a mōke / aboute xxxviij yere in cesaree and in Capadoce / And by hys wordes and hys example / many men conuerted he to the fayth of cryste / And whan thys cam to the knowleche of octouian the prouoste / he toke hym and wold haue constrayned hym to do sacrefise to thydollis / And saynt longius said / Ther may noman serue two lordes whyche ben contrary to other / Thyn ydollis ben lordes of thy malices / corruptours of all good werkis and enemyes to chastyte / humylite and to bounte / And frendes to all ordure of luxurye / of gloutonnye / of ydelnesse / of pryde / and of Auaryce / And my lord is lord of sobrenesse that bryngeth the peple to the euerlastyng lyf / Thenne sayd the prouoste / it is nought y t thou saist / Make sacrefice to thydollis And thy god shal forgyue the by cause of the comandement that is made to the / longius said yf thou wylt becomē cristen / god shal pardonne the thy trespaces / Thenne the prouost was angry and made the teeth of saynt longius to be drawen out of hys mouth / and dyde do cutte hys mouth open / And yet for alle that longius lost not hys speche / but toke an axe that he there fonde & hewe and brake therwith thydollis and said / now may we see yf they be very goddes or not / And anon the deuyllis yssued out and entred in to the body of the prouoste / amd hys felaws / And they brayed lyke beestes / and fyll doun to the feet of saynt longius / and sayd we knowe wel that thou art seruaunt vnto the souerayn god / And saynt longius demaunded of the deuylles why they dwellyd in thyse ydollis / and they answerd / we haue foūden place / in thyse ydolles for vs / For ouerall where Ihesu crist is not named ne hys signe is not shewd / there dwelle we gladly / and by cause whan thyse paynems come to thyse ydolles for to adoure and make sacrefise in the name of vs / thenne we come and dwelle in thyes ydolles / wherfor we pray the man of god that thou sende vs not in in thabysme of helle / And saynt longius said to the peple that there were / what saye ye wyll ye haue thyse deuylles for your goddes and worshyppe them / Or haue ye leuer that I hunte them out of thys world in the name of Ihesu cryst / And the peple sayd wyth an hye voys / Moche grete is the god of crysten peple / holy man we praye the that thou suffre not the deuylles to dwelle in thys cyte / Thenne comanded saynt longius to the deuyllis that they shold yssue out of thys peple in suche wyse that the peple had grete Ioye / and byleued in our lord / A lytyl tyme after / the euyl prouost made saynt longius come to fore hym / and sayd to hym that all the peple were departed & by hys enchaūtement had refused thydollis / yf the kynge knewe it / he shold destroye vs and the cyte also / Afrodisius answerd / how wilt thou yet torm̄ good man whyche hath saued vs and hath don so moche good to the cyte And the prouost said / he hath deceyued vs by enchantrye / Afrodisius said hys god is grete / and hath none euyll in hym / Thenne dyde the prouost cutte out the tongue of afrodisius / wherfore saynt longius sighed vnto god / And anone the prouoste becam blynde / and loste all hys membres / whan afrodifius sawe that / he said / lord god thou art Iuste / And thy Iugement is verytable / And the prouost said to afrodisius / Fayr brother praye to saynt longius that he pray for me / For I haue don yll to hym / And Afrodisius said / haue not I wel told it to the / do nomore so to longius / Seest not thou me speke wythout tongue / And the prouoste sayde / I haue not only l and

anon thenne the prouost dyde do smyte of hys heed / And after he cam and fyll on the body of saynt longius and sayd all in wepyng / Syre I haue synned I knowleche and confesse my fylthe / And anon cam agayn his sight and he receyued helthe of hys body / And buryed honourably the body of saynt longius / And the prouoste byleuyd in Ihesu cryst / And abode in the company of crysten men and thanked god and deyde in good astate / All thys happed in Cesaree of Capadoce to the honour of our lord god / to whom be gyuen laude and glorye in secula seculorum • thys •st myn eyen / but also my herte Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Longius Here begynneth the lif of saynt Maure THe yere that saynt benet deied / he sente seynt Maure / & foure felaws wyth hym in to fraunce / that is to wete fuscinien symplicien Antoninien and constantinen atte prayer of varricam the bysshop of maulx for to founde an abbaye which the said bisshop wold make of hys owen good / And gaf to saynt maure a book in whyche he had wreton the rule of hys hande / And as they passed the montaynes of mongus sourgus one of theyr seruantes fyll fro hys hors vpon a grete stone / and hys lyft fote was all to frusshed / but assone as saynt maure had blessyd it and made hys oryson / he was guarisshed and al hool / After thys he cam in to the chyrche of saynt mauryce / And ther was at entre a blynde man beggyng that had seten there xj yere and was named lieuyn / whyche for the longe vsage that he had ben there / he knew all thoffice of the chirche by heryng that he had lerned ther by wythout more / he coniured saynt maure by the vertue of the martirs that he wold helpe hym / And anone he was guarisshid and had agayn hys sight by hys prayer / And thenne saynt maure comāded hym that he shold serue alle hys lyf in the chyrche as he had don / On a nyght thys holy man and hys felawe herberowed in y e hows of a wydowe / whiche was named themere / the whyche had a sone that was so seke that eche man sayd that he was deed / And thys holy man heled hym / And whan he was hool he said to saynt maure / thou art he / that by thy merytes and by thy teeres hast delyuerd me fro the Iugement where I was in condempned to the fyre of helle / Thus as they helde theyr waye on the good fryday in thabbaye of whyche seynt Romayn was abbot / And saynt maure sayd to saynt Romayn Seynt benet shal departe out of thys world to morowe / On the morn after the hour of tierce as saynt maure was in hys prayers he sawe the waye by whyche saynt benet mounted in to heuen / and he was aourned wyth palles and grete foyson of clerenes / and thys vision sawe two other monkes / Also whan saynt maure & hys felowe cam to orlyance / they herd saye that the bisshop varicam of maulx was deed / And he that was in his place wold not receyue them / Thenne saynt maure and hys felawe wente in to a place that is callyd restis / And there founded and coma and was all to frusshed but saynt maure heled hym anon / And after flocus whyche was one of the grettest frendes of the kynge had hym in so grete reuerence / that he durst not approuche / but yf he bad hym / Thre werkmen that wrought in that hows bygan to saye shrewdly of saynt maure / and saye that he coueyted ouer moche vayne glorye / but anon they be cam so madde that that one of hym lost forthwyth hys lyf / And the other ij to tare them self wyth theyr teeth / the holy man anon put hys hande in theyr mouthes / and made the feende to goo out benethe / And after he reysed the thyrde to lyf whyche had be deed / and comanded hym yf he wold lyue / that he shold nomore entre in to that hows / And thys comāded he for theschewe the fauour of the world / Theodebers kyng of frannce cam for to visite hym / and prayd to saynt maure and the brethern that they wold pray for hym / And he gaf to them of that hows the fee Ryall of that buscage / and alle the rentes therto belongyng / and the townes / On the morn saynt maure wente to see the yeft that the kyng had gyuen / And there he heled one hauyng the paleseye / whyche had be vij yere seke / The second yere that thys hows was founded cam many noble men of the contre whyche demanded that theyr chyldren myght be clothed and receyued in to the religion And ther cam so many that the xxvj yere of the fondacion of thabbaye there were an hondred & fourty brethern / & saynt maure comandeth that they shold abyde in that nombre wythout more or lasse / and not tencreace ne mynuysshe that nombre / After thys And gaf therto the chyef of blason and the toun longchamp therwith / And after thys tyme saynt maure wold nomore yssue out of thabbeye / but he wente and abode in a side of the chyrche of saynt martyn where he had made an hous for hym / and had wyth hym two monkes for to serue hym / but he ordeyned to fore / that bercuses shold be abbot after hym / whan he had ben in hows that ij yere & an half / the deuyl appiered to hym on a tyme / whyche was in hys orysons / and sayd to hym that there shold be grete destruction of hys brethern / but the angele of our lord cam after hym whyche reconforted hym And thenne he cam vnto the brethern and said to them that he and many of them therwithin / shold passe out of thys world / And it happed that with in a moneth after there deyed C and xvj monkes of that abbeye / And of all the nōbre there abode nomoo alyue but xxiiij / And thenne deyde Anthonyn and constantin that were comen wyth hym / A lytyl whyle after deyde saynt maure of the payne of his side the xlj yere after he was comen theder the xviij kalendes of feuerer / And he deyde to fore thaulter of saynt Martyn where he was couerd wyth an heyr / The other of hys felawshyp retorned to mount cassyn / And thus accomplysshyd thys blessyd saynt hys lyf in the tyme of lowys thempereur the second / And the body of saynt maure was born fro thabbaye in Angeo named gaunefuelle for fere of the normans vnto the abbaye of fosses / where hys body is now / whyche Abbaye founded saynt banolanis disciple to saynt collon bain / his feste is the xv day of Ianyuer •e fyrst an hows for to adoure god there in thonour of saynt martyn / •ded that he shold be buryed therin A clerke that was there named langyso fyl doun of an hie steyer vpon an hepe of stones / •lotaire the kynge cam in to thys abbeye / Here endeth the lyf of saynt Maure Here foloweth the lyf of saynt Patryke and thynterpretacion of hys name PAtryke is as moche to saye as knowleche / For by the wyll of god he knewe many of the secretes of heuen and of the Ioyes there / And also he sawe a partye of the paynes of helle / ¶Of Seynt Patryke SAynt Patryke was born in brytayne whyche is called Englond / And was lerned atte Rome and there flourid in vertues / And after departed out of the partyes of ytalye where he had longe dwellyd and cam home in to hys coutre in walis named pendyac / And entred in to a fayr and Ioyous contre called the valeye Rosyne / To whom thangele of god appiered & said / O patryke this see ne bysshopriche god hath not { pro } uyded to the but vnto one not yet born / but shal xxx yere here after be born / And so he left that contre and Saylled ouer in to yrlonde / And as chester sayth in polycronycon the fourth booke the xxix chapytre that saynt patryke fader was named caprum which was a preest & a dekens sone whyche was called fodum And saynt patrykes moder was named conches martyns suster of fraūce / in his baptesme he was named Sucate / and saynt germayn callid hym magonius / & celestinus the pope named hym patryke / that is as moche to saye as fader of the cytezeyns / Sanyt patryke on a day as he prechyd a sermon of the paciēce & suffraūce of the passyon of our lord Ihesu cryst / to the kyng of the contre / he leued vpon hys croche or croos / And it happed by auēture / that he sette the ende of the croche or his staf vpon the kynges foot / & perced his foot with the pike whiche was sharp byneth / the kynge hath supposed y e saynt patryke had don it wetyngly / for to meue hym y e sonner to pacyenee and to the feythe of god / But Whan saynt Patryke aperceyued it / he was moche abasshed / and by hys prayers he helyd the kynge / And furthermore he Impetred & gate grace of our lord / that no venemous beest myght lyue in al the contre / And yet vnto this day is no venemous beest in alle yrelond / ¶ After it happed on a tyme that a man of that contre stale a sheep whiche bylonged to his neyghbour / where vpon Saynt Patryke admonested the peple / that who someuer had taken hit / shold delyuer it ageyn wythin seuen dayes / whan al the peple were assemblyd wythin the chyrche / & the man whiche had stolen it made no semblaunte / to rendre ne delyuer ageyn thys sheep / Thenne saynt Patryke commaunded by the vertu of god that the sheep shold blete and crye in the bely of hym that had eten hit / And so happed it / that in the presence of al the peple the sheep cryed and bleted in the bely of hym that had stolen hit / And the man that was culpable repented hym of his trespace / And the other fro thenne forthon kepte them fro stelyng of sheep fro ony other man / Also saynt Patrike was wonte for to worshyp and do reuerence vnto al the crosses deuoutelye that he myght see / But on a tyme tofore the sepulcre of a paynym stood a fayre crosse / whiche he passed and went forth by as he had not seen hit / And he was demaunded of his felawes / why he sawe not that crosse / And thenne he prayed to god he sayd for to knowe whos hit was / & he sayd he herde a voys vnder the erthe sayeng / thou sawest it not / bycause I am a paynym that am buryed here / & am vnworthy that the signe of the crosse shold stonde there / wherfore he made the sygne of the crosse to be taken thens / On a tyme as saynt patryke preched in yrelond the feythe of Ihesu crist & dyd but lytel prouff yte by his predycacion / for he coude not conuerte the euyl rude / and wylde peple / And he prayed to our lord Ihesu cryst that he wold shewe them somme signe openly ferdeful and gastful / by whiche they myght be conuerted / and be repentaūt god Saynt Patryke made in therthe a grete cercle with his staffe / & anone therthe after the quantyte of the cercle openyd / And there appyered a grete pytte and a deep / & saynt patryke by the reuelacion of god vnderstood that there was a place of purgatorye / In to whiche who someuer entred therin / he shold neuer haue other penaunce ne fele none other payne / & there was shewed to hym that many shold entre whiche shold neuer retourne ne come ageyn / And they that shold retourne shold abyde but fro one morne to another and nomore / And many entred that came not ageyn / As touchyng this pytte or hole whyche is named saynt Patrikes purgatorye / Somme holde opynyon that the second patryke whiche was an abbot and no bysshop / that god shewed to hym this place of purgatorye / but certeynly suche a place there is in yrelond wherein many men haue been / and yet dayly go on in / and come ageyn / and somme haue had there meruayllous vysions / and seen grysly and horryble paynes of whome there been bookes maad / as of Tundale and other / Thenne this holy man saynt patryke the bysshop lyued tyl he was Cxxij yere olde / and was the first that was bysshop in yrelonde / and deyed in aurelyus ambroses tyme that was kyng of brytayn / In hys tyme was the abbot columba otherwyse named colinkyllus & saynt bride whom Saynt Patryke professyd and veylled And she ouer lyued hym fourty yere Alle these thre holy sayntes were buryed in vlster in the cyte of Dunence / as it were in a caue wyth thre chambres her bodyes were founden atte first comyng of kyng Iohan kyng harry the secondes sone in to yrelond / vpon whos tombes thyse verses folowyng were wryton / Hic iacent in duno / qui tumilo

second that he had graunte of our lord god / that none yrysshe man shal abyde the comyng of antecryst / The iij wonder is redde of hys purgatorye whyche is more referred to the lasse saynt Patryk thabbot / And this holy abbot by cause he founde the people of that londe rebelle / he went out of yrlond & came in to englond to the abbey of glastenberye where he deyed on a saynt bartylmewes day / He flouryd about the yere of our lord viijCL / & the holy bysshoy deyed the yere of our lord foure hondred iiij score & x in the hondred and xxij yere of his age / to whome praye we that he praye for

in this lyf / Or for as moche as he deseruyd for to haue blessynges or benediccions perpetuel / And the holy doctour Saynt gregory wrote his lyf / ¶Of saynt benet thabbot TAynt benet was borne of the prouynce of Nurcia / And was sente to Rome for to studye / but in hys Infancye he lefte the scoles and wente in to a deserte / and his nouryce whych tenderly loued hym wēt alweye wyth hym tyl they came to a place named offyde / And there she borowed a vessel for to pourge or wyne we whete / but the vessel fyl to therthe by neclygence / and was broken in two peces / And whan saynt Benet sawe his nouryce wepe / he had grete pyte / & made his prayers to almyghty god & after made hit also hole as it had been tofore / Thenne they of the contre tooke hit / and henge hit on the fronte of the chyrche in wytnesse of one soo fayre a myracle / Thenne lefte saynt benet hys nourice and fledde secretely and came in to an hermytage / where he was neuer knowen of no man but of a monke named romayn whiche mynystred to hym mete for to ete / And bycause that there was no waye fro the monasterye of romayn vnto the pytte where Saynt Benet was / he knytte the loof in a corde & so lete hit doun to hym / And bycause he shold here whā romayn shold lete doun the breed / he bonde a belle on the corde and by the sowne therof / he receyued his breed / But the deuyl hauyng enuye of the charitee of that one / and of the refeccion of that other / cast a stone and brake the belle / but neuerthelesse Romayn lefte not to mynystre hym / It happed that there was a preest on an estern day that had arayed his dyner for hym self / and our lord appered to hym and sayd / thou ordeynest for thy self delycious metes / and my seruaunt deyeth for hunger in suche a pytte and named hym the place / Thenne the preest aroos and bare his mete wyth hym / & sought soo longe that he fonde Saynt benet in grete payne / whan he had founden hym he sayd to hym / Aryse and take thy mete and refeccion / For it is ester day / He answerd I knowe wel that hit is the feste of paske / bycause that I see the / The preest sayd to hym Certeynly thys day is the day of ester and saynt benet wyst hyt not / by cause he had dwellyd there so longe and so ferre fro people / Thenne sayd they graces and made the benedyccion and toke theyr refeccyon / It happed after thys that a blacke byrde that is called a merle came on a tyme to saynt benet / and peckyd with his bylle at his vysage / And greuyd and noyed hym so moche that he coude haue no reste for it / and coude not put it from hym / but assone as he had made the signe of the crosse / anone the birde vanysshyd away / And after that cam to hym a grete temptaciō of the flessh by the whyche the deuyl tempted hym in shewyng hym a womā and brente sore and was enflamed in hys corage / but anon he cam agayn to hym self / and after he despoylled hym self all naked and wente emong thornes and walowed emong the nettels so that his body was torn and payned by whyche he heled the woundes of his herte / Thenne after that tyme / he felte nomore temptacion of hys flessh / ¶ It happed that thabbot of a monastery was deed / And for the good renom said that hys condicions and maners were not acordyng to theyres / Notwythstondyng he was vaynquysshyd and so Instauntly requyred / that atte laste he consented But whan he sawe they lyuyd not ne were not ruled acordyng to theyr religion and rewle / he repreued and correctyd them vigorously / And whan they sawe that they myght not doo their wylles vnder hym / They gaf hym venym medlyd wyth wyn for to drynke / but saynt benet made the signe of the crosse ouer it and blessyd it / and anon the vessell brake in pieces whyche was of glasse / whan saynt benet thēne knesoe that in that vesselle was mortal drynke / whyche myght not abyde ne suffre the signe of the crosse / he roos vp and sayd god haue mercy on you fair brethern / I sayde to you wel atte begynnyng / that my condicions and maners apparteyne not to youres / Fro hensforth gete to you another fader / For I may no lenger dwelle here / Thenne wente he agayn to deserte where god shewed for hym many signes & myracles / and founded there two abbeyes / Now it happed that in one of thyes two abbeyes was a monke that myght not endure longe in prayers / And whan the other of hys felawys were in prayer / he wold goo out of the chyrche / Thenne thabbot of that abbaye shewd thys to saynt benet / And anone he wente for to see yf it were trewe / And whan he cam he sawe that the deuyl in lyknes of a lytyl bla chy drewe hym out of the chyrche by hys cowle / Thenne •d sayd saynt benet to the abbot / and to saynt maure / See ye not hym that draweth hym out / they sayd naye / thenne sayd late vs praye to god that we may see hym / whan they had made theyr prayers / saynt maure sawe hym / but the abbot myght not see hym The next day saynt benet toke a rodde and bete the monke / And thenne he abode in prayer / lyke as the deuyl had be beten / and durst nomore come & drawe hym awaye / And fro than forthon he abode in prayer / & contynued therin Of the xij abbeyes that saynt benet had founded / thre of them stoode on hye Roches so that they myght haue no water but by grete labour / Thenne cam the monkes to hym & prayd hym that he wold sette thyse abbeyes in som̄e other place / by cause they had grete defaute of water / Thenne wente saynt benet aboute the montayne & made hys orysons & prayers moche deuoutly / and whan he had longe prayd he sawe thre stones in a place for a signe / And on the morn whan the monkes cam for to praye / he said to them / goo ye to suche a place where ye shal fynde thre stones / and there dygge a lityl & ye shal fynde water / Our lord can wel prouyde for you water / And they wente and fonde the montaygne all swetyng / where as the thre stones were / And there they digged & anon they fonde water so grete habundaunce that it suffysed to them / and ran doun fro the toppe of the hille vnto bynethe in to the valeye / It happed on a tyme that a man hewe buysshes & thornes aboute the monasterye / And hys axe or instrument of yron that he hewe sprang out of the helue & fyll in to a depe water / thenne the man cryed and sorowed for hys tool / and saynt benet sawe that he was ouer anguysshid therfore / & toke the helue & threwe it after in to the pytte / And anon the yron cam vp & bygā to s •e of thys holy man saynt benet / All the monkes of thabbaye gaf theyr voys and electe saynt benet for theyr abbot / But he accorded not therto ne agreed to them / For he •k •ym̄e tyl that it entred in to the helue / In thabbaye of saynt benet was a chyld named placidus whyche wente to the Ryuer for to drawe water / And hys foot slode so that he fyl in to the Ryuer whyche was moche deep / and anon the Ryuer bare hym forth more than a bowe shote / And whan saynt benet whyche was in hys studye knew it / he called to saynt maure and sayd that ther was a chyld whyche was a monke that was aboute to be drowned and bad hym go to helpe hym / And anon saynt maure ranne vpon the water lyke as it had ben on drye ground and hys feet drye / ¶ And toke vp the chyld by the heer / And drewe hym to londe / And after whan he cam to saynt benet / he sayd that it was not by hys meryte / but by the vertue of hys obedyence / Ther was a preest named florentyn / whyche had enuye on saynt benet / and he sente to hym a loof of bred enuenymed / After whan saynt benet had thys loof / he knewe by the Inspiracion / that it was enuenymed / he gaf it to a rauen that was wonte to take hys fedyng of saynt benettes hand / And comaunded hym to bere it vnto suche a place that nomā shold fynde it / Thenne the rauen made semblaunt for tobeye to the comandement of saynt benet / but he durste not touche it for the venym / and fledde aboute it / howlyng and cryeng / Saynt benet sayd to hym take thys brede hardyly and bere it away / Atte laste the rauen bare it awaye in to suche a place / that ther was neuer herd tydynges therof after / And cam agayn the thyrde day after / and toke hys refection of saynt benettes hand / as he was wonte to doo to fore / whan thys preest Florentyn sawe that he coude not slee saynt benet / he enforced hym to slee spyrytuelly the sowles of hys dyscyples / he toke seuen maydens all naked / & sente them in to the gardyn to daunse & to carolle for to meue the monkes to temptacion / whan saynt benet sawe the malyce of florentyn / he had fere of hys dyscyples / and sente hem out of that place / whan florentyn sawe that saynt benet and hys monkes wente out he demened grete Ioye and made grete feste / And anō the soler fyl vpon hym and slewe hym sodenly whan saynt maure sawe that florentyn was deed / he ranne after saynt benet / and called hym sayeng / come agayn / for florentyn that hath don so moche harme to you is deed / whan saynt benet herde thys / he was sory for the perryllous deth of florentyn & by cause saynt maure was glad for the deth of hys enemye as hym semed he enioyned hym penaunce therfor / After thys he wente to mount Cassyn where he had another grete aduesarye / For in the place where that appolyn was adoured / he made an oratorye of saynt Iohan baptyst / and conuerted alle the contre aboute to the crysten fayth / wherof the deuyl was so tormented / that he appyered to saynt benet alle blacke and ranne vpon hym wyth open mouth and throte / And had hys eyen alle enflammed / And sayd to hym / Benet / Benet / And saynt Benet answerd not / the deuyl sayd / Cursid and not blessyd why haue I so moche persecucion / ¶ Hyt happed on a tyme that as the monkes shold lyft a stone for a werke of an edefyce / they myght not meue it / thenne ther assembled a grete multitude of peple / and yet they alle myght not lyfte it / But anone as saynt Benet had blessyd it / they lift it a non / Thenne apparceyued they that the deuyl was vpon it / and caused it to be so heuy / And whan they had a lytyl made the walle hye / the deuyll appyerid to saynt Benet / and bad hym goo see them that edeffyed / thenne saynt Benet sente to hys monkes / & comanded that they shold kepe them wel / For the deuyll wente to destroye them / but er the messager cam to them the deuyl had throwen doun a parte of the wall and had therwith slayn a yong monke / Thenne they brought the monke alle to brused in a sack to saynt Benet / And anon saynt benet made vpon hym the signe of the crosse and blessyd hym / and reysed hym to lyf / and sente hym to the werke agayn / A laye man of honest lyf had acustome ones in the yere to come to saynt benet all fastyng / & on a tyme as he cam ther was one that bare mete accompayned wyth hym / And desired that he wold ete with hym but he refused it / After he prayd hym the second tyme / and yet he refused it / and sayd he wold ete no mete tyl he cam to saynt benet / At the third tyme he fonde a fayr fontayne / and a moche delytable place / And began sore to desire hym to ete wyth hym / And atte laste he consented and ete / And whan he cam to saynt benet / he said to hym / where hast thou eten / which answerd I haue eten a lytyl / O fayr brother the deuyl hath deceyued the / but he coude not deceyue the fyrst ne the second tyme / but the thyrd tyme he hath surmounted the / thenne the good man kneled doun to the feet of saynt benet and confessyd hym of hys trespaas / Attila the kyng of gothes wold ones preue yf saynt benet had the sperite of prophecye / and sente to hym hys seruaunt and dyde do araye hym with precious robes / and delyuerd to hym a grete companye as he had ben the kyng hym self / whan saynt benet sawe hym come he sayd to hym fayr sone / doo of that thou werest it is not thyn / & the man fyl doun anon to the ground by cause he mocqued the holy man and deyde anon / A knyght that was vexed with the deuyl was brought to saynt benet for to be heled / And saynt benet put hym out / and after sayde to the knyght / Goo and fro hensforth ete nomore flessh / and goo nomore to none ordre / For what day thou goost & takest ordres the deuyl shal reentre in to the / Thys knyght helde hym longe tyme wythout takyng ony / tyl atte laste he sawe yonger than he / that wente to ordres / And had forgete the wordes of saynt benet / and toke ordres / And anon the deuyl entryd in to hys body / and tormented hym tyl he deyde / Ther was a man that sente to saynt benet ij flagons of wyn but he that bare them hydde that one / And presented that other wythout more / whā saynt benet had receyued the presente / he thanked hym moche / and sayd to hym / Fayr brother take good hede how y u shalt doo wyth that whyche thou hast hyd / and drynke not therof For thou knowest not what is therin Thenne he was asshamed and so confused wente from hym / And whan he cam to the place where he had hyd it / he wold wyte what was therin / lyke as saynt benet had told to hym / and bowed it a lytyl / and anon a serpent yssued out / ¶ It happed on a tyme that saynt benet ete / and a yong man whyche was sone to a grete lord helde to hym a candel / and began to thynke in hys herte / who is thys that I serue / I am sone vnto a grete man / hyt apperteyneth not that one so gentyl a man as I am / be seruant to hym / whan saynt benet sawe by experience the pryde that aroos in thys monke / he called another monke / and made hym to holde the candell / And after sayd to hym / what is that thou hast / blesse thy herte brother blesse it / god forgyue it the / Now thou shalt serue me nomore / goo in to thy cloystre and reste the there / Ther was a man of the kyng of gothes whyche was named Zallas which tormented ouer cruelly the crysten men by cause he was of the secte of tharryēs in suche wise that where he fonde clerkes or monkes he slewe them / Thenne it happed on a day that he tormented a uylayn or a carle for the couetyse of hys good / whan the carle sawe that he wold take all / he gaf all that euer he had to saynt benet / Thenne left Zallas to tormente hym a lytyl / but he bonde hym wyth the reynes of hys brydell / & droof hym to fore / and he rode after tyl that he cam to thabbaye of saynt benet and bad hym that he shold shewe to hym this benet / whan he cam theder he saw saynt benet stonde to fore the gate allone & studyed in a book / thēne sayd the vylayne to the traūt / Loo ther is benet that thou demaundest after / whan Zallas had loked on hym cruelly lyke he had ben acustomed he had supposed to haue delt wyth hym / lyke as he had doo wyth other crysten men And sayd to saynt benet / Aryse vp anone and delyuer to me the goodes of thys carle whyche thou hast by the / whan saynt benet herde he lyft vp a lytyl hys eyen / and be And anon by grete meruaylle hys armes were vnbounden / And whan the carle sawe hym self vnbounden / he stode to fore the tyrant Appertely wythout drede / And anon Zallas fyl doun to the feet of saynt benet and recomanded hym to hys prayers / And neuer for al thys left saynt benet to rede on hys book / but called hys monkes and comāded that his mete shold be brought to hym / and the monkes dyde so / And sith bare it away / Thenne admonested saynt Benet the tyraunt and sayd to hym that he shold leue hys cruelte and hys wodenes / And he de { per } ted & neuer after that day / he demanded of vylayn ony good / ne of the man that saynt benet had vnboūden only by his sight / ¶ It happed ouer alle champayne where as he dwellyd / that so grete famyne was in the contre that moch peple deyed for hungre / thenne alle the breed of thabbaye faylled / and ther was wythin but v loues for all the couent / whan saynt benet sawe that they were abasshyd / he began debonairly to chastyse & warne them that they shold haue theyr hertes on hye to god and sayd to them / Wherfore are ye in so grete mesease for brede / yf ye haue no ne thys day ye shal haue to morn / now it happed that on the morn they fonde at theyr yate two honderd muddes of mele / whyche were proprely sente fro god / For neuer man wyst / fro whens they cam / whan the monkes sawe that they thanked god / and lerned that they ought not doubte / ne of habundaunce ne of pouerte / ••lde the carle that was to fore hym / ¶ It happed on a tyme that saynt benet sente hys monkes for to edefye an abbaye / and sayd that at a certayn day he wold come see them and shewe them what they shold doo / Thenne the nyght to fore that he had sayd to come / he appyered to the maystre and to hys monkes / and shewed to them alle the places that they shold bylde / but they byleuyd not thye vysion / and supposed it had be but a dreme / Thenne whan they sawe that he cam not they retorned and sayd to hym / Fayr fader we haue abyden that thou sholdest haue comen to vs / lyke as thou promysest vs thenne answerd he what is that ye saye remembre not ye that I appyeryd to you that nyght that I promysed you / & enseygned and told how ye shold doo Goo your way and doo in suche wyse as I deuysed to you in the vysion / ¶Ther were two nonnes nyghe vnto hys monasterye whyche were of moche noble lygnage / whyche were moche talkatyf and restrayned not wel theyr tongues / but tormented ouermoche hym that gouerned them / ¶ And whan he had shewed this to saynt benet / he sente them word / that they shold better kepe scilence and rule theyr tongues / or he wold curse them / but they for alle that wold not leue it / And so anon after they deyde and were buryed in the chyrche / And whan the deken cryed in thende of the masse / that they that were acursed shald goo out of the chyrche / the nourisse that had nourisshed them / and that euery day had offred for them / byhelde and sawe that whan the deken sange so they yssued out of theyr sepulcres and wente out of the chyrche / ¶ And whan saynt benet knewe herof / he offred for them hym self and assoylled them / Thenne after that whan the deken said so as a fore / they neuer yssued out after / as theyr noucices had seen them ¶Ther was a monke goon out for to see hys fader and moder wythout lycence and blessyng of hys abbotte / And the day after he cam theder he deyd / And whan he was buryed in therthe / therthe caste hym out agayn And so it dyde twyes / thenne cam the fader and moder to saynt benet / and told hym how the erthe threwe hym and wold not receyue hym / and prayd that he wold blesse hym / Thenne toke he the blessyd sacrament / and made it to be leyde on the breste of the corps / And whan they had doon so they buried hym / and therthe drewe hym nomore out / but receyued the body & helde it / ¶Ther was a monke that coude not abide in the monastery & prayd so moche to saynt benet / that he lete hym goo & was all angry / and anon as he was out of thabbaye / he fonde a dragon with open mouth / And whan he sawe hym he had fere that he wold haue deuoured hym / & cried lowde / Come hether and helpe me / come hether / For this dragon wil deuoure me / thēne the monkes ranne / but they sawe no dragon / and brought agayn the monk trēblyng & syghyng thenne the monke promysed that he neuer wold departe fro thabbaye ¶ In a tyme ther was in that centre a grete famyne / and all that euer saynt benet myght gete & haue / he gaue it to the poure peple / in so moche that he had nomore in the abbaye but a lytyl oyle / and he comanded yet to the celerer to gyue it to a poure man the celerer vnderstode hym wel / but he gaf it not / by cause ther was nomore in the couent / And whan saynt benet knewe it he toke the vessel / and cast it out of the wyndow & was of glasse / & it felle on a stone / & brake not / thenne he repreued the celerer of inobedience / & of a lityl hope that he had in god / & after he wente vnto hys prayers / And anon a grete empty tonne that was there / was full of oylle in so moche that it ranne ouer / ¶ It happed an other day that saynt benet wente to visite hys suster named scolastica / And as they satte atte table / She prayd her brother that he wold abyde there al that nyght but he in no wyse wold graunte her / and sayd he myght not lye out of hys cloyster / ¶ And whan she sawe that he wold not graunte to her to abyde / she enclyned her heed and made her prayers to our lord / ¶ And anon it began to thōdre & to lyghtne / & the ayer to wexe derke / whyche to fore was fayr & clere / and a grete rayn fyl doun / so that for nothyng he myght departe / And lyke as she wepte wyth her eyen / right so forthwyth the rayne and storme cam / and thenne she lyft vp her heed / Thēne saynt benet said to his suster / almyghty god forgyue you that ye haue don For ye haue letted me that I may not departe hens / And she said / Fayr brother god is more curtoys than ye be / For ye wold not accepte my prayer / but god hath herd me / now goo yf ye may And thenne saynt benet abode there / all the nyght spekyng of god bytwene hym and hys suster / wythout slepyng tyl they were bothe eased / On the morn saynt benet wente to hys abbaye / And on the thyrde day after he lyft vp hys eyen to heuen / and sawe the sowle of hys suster mounte vp in to heuen in the lyknes of a douue / And anon he dyde the body of her to be brought to hys abbaye / and dyde it to be buryed in hys tombe / whyche he had do made for hym self / On a nyght as saynt benet was in hys pyayer at a wyndowe / he sawe the sowle of saynt germayn bysshop of capes mounte in to heuen / And lyke as a light sodayne that enlumyneth all the derknesses of the world / so the light of that sowle gaf a grete light / And after he knewe that the sowle of saynt germayn passed that same hour / After thys whan tyme cam / that saynt benet hym self shold de { per } te out of this world he shewd it to hys monkes sixe dayes to fore / and dyde do make hys pytte / and after that a feuer toke hym strongly / whyche helde hym euery day / and atte the sixthe day / he dyde hym self to be born to the chyrche / And there receyued the body of our lord Ihesu cryst And after emong the handes of hys dyscyples / hys owen handes lyftyng vp to heuen / in makyng hys oryson he rendryd hys sowle vnto hys creatour / The same hour was a reuelacion shewd to two monkes / For they sawe a way to heuen all couerd with palles & man tellis of gold / alle ful of torches brennyng / whyche enlumyned alle the heuen / whyche cam fro the celle of saynt benet vnto heuen / And ther was a mā in a fayr habyte / to whome thyse monkes demaunded / what way that was And he answerd that it was the way by whyche saynt benet mounted vp to heuen / ¶ Thenne the body of saynt benet was buryed in the oratorye that he had made of saynt Iohan / where as was wonte to be the aulter of appollyn the xere of our lord vC and xviij / To whom late vs praye deuoutly that he praye to our lord for vs that we may haue grace after thys lyf to come to euerlastyng blysse in heuen / Amen / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt benet Abbote Here next foloweth the lyf of saynt Cuthberd of durham Saynt cuthberd was born in englond / And whan he was viij yere old our lord shewd for hym a fayr myracle / for to drawe hym to his loue For on a tyme as he pleyed atte the balle wyth other chyldren / Sodenly ther stode emonge them a fayr yong child of the age of iij yere / which was the fayrest creature that euer they behelde / And anon he sayd to cuthberd / good broder vse no suche vayne plaies ne sette not thy herte on them / But for all that cuthberd toke none heed to his wordes / And thenne thys chyld fyll doun and made grete heuynes / wepte sore / and wronge hys hondes / And thenne Cuthberd and the other chyldren lefte theyr playe and comforted hym and demaunded of hym why he made suche sorow / Thenne the chyld sayd to Cuthbert / all myn heuynesse is only for the / by cause thou vsist suche vayne playes / for our lord hath chosen the to be an heed of holy chyrche / And thenne sodenly he vanysshyd away / And thenne he knewe veryly / that it was an Angele sente fro our lord to hym / And fro thenne forthon he lefte all suche vayne playes / & neuer vsed them more / and began to lyue holyly And thenne he desired of hys fader / that he myght be sette to scole / and anon he drewe hym to parfyght lyuyng / for he was euer in his prayers nyght and daye / And most desired of our lord to doo that which myght plese hym and eschewe that shold dysplese hym / and he lyued so vertuosly and holyly that all the peple had Ioye of hym / and within a whyle after Aydanus the bisshop deyde / And as cuthberd kept shepe in the felde / he lokyd vp ward and sawe angellis bare the sowle of Aydanus the bysshop to heuen with grete melodye / And after that saynt cuthberd wold nomore kepe sheep but wēte anon to thabbaye of geru And there he was a monke / of whome all the couēte were right glad / and thanked our lord that had sente hym theder / For he lyued there ful holyly in fastyng and grete penaunce doyng / And atte last he had the gowte in hys knees whiche he had taken of cold in knelyng vpon the cold stones / whan he said hys prayers in suche wyse that hys knee hegan to swelle / And the synewys of hys legge were shronke / that he myght neyther goo ne stratche out hys legge / but euer he toke it ful paciently / and sayd whan it plesith our lord / it shal passe away / And within a whyle after his brethern for to doo hym cōfort bare hym in to the felde / And there they mette wyth a knyght / whyche sayd late me see and handle thys cuthbertis legge / And thenne whan he had felt it wyth hys handes / he bad them take the mylk of a cowe of one colour / and the Iuse of smal plātayn / And fair whete flour And seethe them alle to gydre / And make therof a playster / & leye it therto / and it wyl make hym hool / And assone as they had so doon he was perfightly hool / And thenne he thanked our lord ful mekely / And after he knewe by reuelaciō that it was an angele sente by our lord to hele hym / of hys grete sekenes and dysease / And thabbot of that place sente hym / to aselle of theyres to be hosteler / for to receyue / there ghestes / and do them confort / And sone after our lord shewd there a fayr myracle for hys seruaunt seynt cuthberd / For Angellis come to hym oftymes in liknes of other ghestis whom he receyued and seruyd dylygently wyth mete and drynke / and other necessaryes / On a tyme ther come ghestis to hym whom he receyued / and wente in to the houses of offyce for to serue them / And whan he cam agayn they were goon / And wente after for to calle and coude not espye them / ne knowe the stappes of theyr feet how wel that it was thenne a snowe / and whan he retorned he fonde the table leide And theron thre fayr whyte loues of brede all hoot whiche were of meruayllous beaute and swetenes / For alle the place smelled of the swete odour of them / Thenne he knewe wel that the Angellis of our lord had ben there / and rendryd thankynges to our lord that he had sente to hym hys angellys for to conforte hym / and euery nyght whā his brethern were a bedde he wold goo and stonde in the cold water al naked vp to the chyn tyl it were myd nyght / And thenne he wold yssue out Anth whā he come to londe / he myght not stonde for feblenes / and fayntnes / but oft fyll doun to the ground / And on a tyme as he laye thus / ther cam ij otters whyche licked euery place of his body / and thenne wente agayn to the water that they cam fro / And thenne saynt cuthberd aroos all hool & wente to hys celle agayn / and wente to matyns wyth hys brethern / but hys brethern knewe nothyng of hys stondyng thus euery nyght in the see to the chyn / but atte laste one of hys brethern espyed it and knewe his doyng and told hym therof / but saynt cuthberd charged hym to kepe it secrete / and telle noman therof duryng his lyf / And after thys within a whyle the bysshop of durham deyed / And saynt cuthberd was electe & sacred bysshop in his stede after hym And euer after he lyued full holyly vnto hys deth / And by his prechyng & ensample gyuyng he brought moche peple to good lyuyng / And to fore hys deth / he lefte his bysshopriche / And wente in to the holy Iland / where he lyuyd an holy and solytary lyf vnto that And was buryed at durham / And after translated and the body leyd in a fayr and honourable shryne where as yet dayly our lerd sheweth for hys seruaunt there many fair and grete myracles / wherfore late vs pray vnto this holy saynt / that he pray for vs / •us / •e beyng ful of vertues rendryd his soule vnto almyghty god / Here foloweth the fest of the anunciacion or salutacion of thangel gabriel to our lady THe feste of thys day is called thanunciacion of our lady / for on thys day thaungel gabriel shewed to the glorious virgyne marye the comyng of the blessyd sone of god / That is to wete how he ought to come in to y e gloryouse vyrgyne / and take in her nature / and flesshe humayne for to saue the world It was wel thyng resonable that than gel shold come to the glorious virgyn marye / For lyke as Eue by thenhortyng of the deuyl / gaf her cousente to doo the synne of Inobedyence to our perdicion / Ryght so by the gretyng of thangel gabryel and by exhortyng the glorious virgyne marye / gaf her consentyng to hys message by obedyence to our saluacion / wherfor lyke as the first woman was cause of our dampnacion / So was the blessyd virgyne marye begynnyng of our redempcion / whan that thangel gabriel was sente for to shewe thyncarnacyon of our sauyour Ih̄u crist he fonde her al one enclosed in her chambre / lyke as saynt bernard sayth / In whyche the maydens & virgynes ought to abyde in theyr howses / wythout rennyng abroode out openly / And they ought also to flee the wordes of men / of whyche theyr honour and good renomee myght be lassed or hurte / And thangele said to the gloryous vyrgyne marye / I salewe the ful of grace / the lord is wyth the / Ther is not founden in scripture in no { per } te suche a salewyng And it was brought fro heuen vnto the glorious virgyne marye / whyche was the first woman that euer in the world offrid to god first her virgynyte / And thaungele said to her after / Thou shalt be blessyd aboue alle other Wymen / For thou shalt escape the malediction that all other wymen haue in chyldyng in synne and in sorowe / and thou shal be moder of god / and shal abyde a pure virgyne and clene / and our blessyd lady was moche abasshid of thys salutacion / and thought in her self the maner therof / Thys was a good maner of a vyrgyne / that so wysely held her stylle / and spack not / and shewyng example to virgynes whiche ought not lyghtly to speke / ne without aduys ne manere / to answere / And whan thangele knewe that for thys salutacion she was tymerous and abasshed / A none he repeased her sayeng / Marye be nothyng aferd / For thou hast founden sothly grace atte god For thou art chosen aboue alle wymen for to receyue his blessyd sone / and be moder to god / and moyen and aduocate for to sette peas bytwene god & man for to destroye the deth and bryng the lyf / O thou that arte a vyrgyne sayth saynt Ambrose / lerne of marye to be manerd and fere ful to all men / lerne to be stylle / & teschewe alle dssolucions / Marye was aferd of the salutacion of thangel / the whyche sayd Thou shalt conceyue / and brynge forth a sone / And thou shalt calle hys name Ihesus / and he shal be callid the sone of god / And marye sayd to the angele / In what maner may thys be that thou sayst / For I haue purposed in myn herte / that I shal neuer know man / And yet I neuer knewe none / how thenne shal I haue a chyld agayn the cours of nature / and may abyde a vyrgyne / Thenne the Angele enformed her / and began to saye / how her vyrgynyte shold be saued in the conceyuyng of the sone of god / & answerd to her in thys maner / The holy ghoost shal come in to the / whyche shal make the to conceyue / the maner how thou shalt conceyue / thou shalt knowe better than I shal conne saye / For that shal be the werke of the holy ghoost / which of thy blood and of thy flessh shal forme purely in the / the body of the chyld that thou shalt b And the vertue of god souerayne shal shadowe the in suche wyse / that thou shalt neuer fele in the ony brennyng ne couetyse carnall / and shal purge thyn herte fro all desires temporell / and yet shal the holy ghoost shadowe wyth the mantel corporel / that the blessyd sone of god shal be hydde in the / and of the / for to couere the right excellente clarte of hys dyuynyte / so that by thys vmbre or shadowe may be knowen and seen hys dygnyte / lyke as huge of saynt victor / and saynt bernard saye / After thangele said / And for as moche as thou shalt conceyue of the holy ghoost / and not of man / the child that shal be born of the shal be called the sone of god / yet of thys concepcion whyche is aboue nature / the Angele sayd to her thys example / Lo elyzabeth thy cosyne whyche is barayne hath conceyued a chyld in her age / For ther is nothyng impossyble to god / whyche is almyghty / Thenne sayd the gloryouse virgyne marye / to thangele the answere for whyche he was comen / lo thandmayde of god / he doo to me that he hath ordeyned after thy wordes She hath gyuen to vs example to be humble whan { pro } speryte of hye Rychesse cometh to vs / For the first word that she spack or said whan she was made moder of god and quene of heuen / that was that she callid her self ancylle or handmayde / and not lady / moche peple is humble in lowe estate and but fewe in hye estate / that is to wete in grete estates / and therfore is humylyte more preysed in them that ben grete in estate / Assone as she sayd loo here the handmayde of god late it ben doo to me after thy wordes / Thomas in compendio / In that same tyme that she had thus gyuen her assente to the angele / She conceyued in her Ihesu cryst whyche in that same hour was in her parfight man and parfight god in one persone / and as wyse as he was in heuen / or whan he was xxx yere old / Thys blessyd Anunciacion happened the xxv day of the moneth of marche / On whyche day happend also as wel to fore as after thyse thynges that here after be named / ¶ On that same day Adam the first man was created / and fyl in to orygynal synne by inobedience / and was put out of paradys terrestre / After thangele shewed the concepcion of our lord to the gloryouse virgyne marye / ¶ Also that same day of the moneth kaym slewe Abel hys broder / Also melchesedech made offryng to god of brede and wyn in the presence of Abraham / Also on the same day Abraham offrid ysaac hys sone / That same day saynt Iohan baptyst was byheded / And saynt peter was that day delyuerd out of pryson / And saynt Iames the more that day byheded of herode / And our lord Ihesu cryst was on that day crucyfyed / wherfore / that is a day of grete reuerence / Of the salutacion that thangel brought to the gloryouse virgyne / ¶We rede an example of a noble knyght / whyche for tamēde hys lyf / gaf and rendryd hym self in to an abbaye of cysteauls / and for as moche as he was no clerke / ther was assygned to hym a maystre for to teche hym and to be with the brethern clerkes / but he coude nothyng lerne in long tyme that he was there sauf thyse two wordes / Aue maria / whyche wordes he had so sore enprynted in his herte / that alleway he had them in his mouthe whersomeuer he was / Atte last he deyde and was buryed in the chyrcheyerde of the brethern / It happed after that vpon the buryels grewe a right fayr flourdelis / And in euery flour was wreton in lettres of gold Aue maria / of whyche myracle alle the brethern were amerueylled / And they dyde open the sepulture / and fonde that the rote of thys flour delis cam out of the mouth of the sayd knyght / And anon they vnderstode that our lord wold haue hym honoured for the grete deuocion that he had to saye these wordes Aue maria / ¶ Another knyght ther was that had a fayr place by side the hye waye where moche peple passed whom he robbed as moche as he myght and so he vsed hys lyf / But he had a good custome / For euery day he salewed the gloryouse vyrgyne marye in sayeng Aue maria / And for no labour he left not to grete our lady as sayd is / It happed that an holy man passed by hys hous / whom he robbed and dyspoylled / But that holy man prayd them that robbed hym that they wold brynge hym to theyr mayster for he had to speke wyth hym in hys hows of a secrete thyng for hys prouffyt / and whan the robbers herde that / they ladde hym to fore the knyght their lord And anon the holy man prayd hym that he wold doo come all hys meyney to fore hym / And whan hys mayne by the comādement of the knyght were assembled / the holy man said / yet ben they not all here / ther is one yet to come / Thenne one of them apperceyued that the chambreleyn of the lord was not comen / And anon the knyght made hym to come / And whan the holy man sawe hym come / anon he said I coniure the by the vertue of Ihesu cryst our lord / that thou saye to vs who thou art / and for what cause thou art comen hether / Anon the chambyrleyn answerd / Alas now muste I saye & knowleche my self / I am noman / but am a deuyl whyche am in the forme of a man and haue take it xiiij yere by whyche space I haue dwellyd with this knyght / For my maystre hath sente me hether / to thende that I shold take hede nyght and day that yf this knyght cessed to saye the salutacion Aue maria For thenne I shold strangle hym with myn owen hand / and bryng hym to helle by cause of the euyl lyf that he hath ledde and ledeth / but by cause he sayeth euery day thys salutacion / Aue maria I myght not haue hym / and therfor I abode here so longe / For ther passeth hym no day but that he saleweth our lady / whan the knyght herd thys he was moche aferd / And fyl doun to the feet of thys holy man / and demāded pardon of hys synnes / After thys the holy man sayd to the deuyl / I comāde the in the name of our lord that thou departe hens / and goo in to another place / where thou mayst greue / ne annoye noman / Thenne late vs praye to the gloryouse virgyne marye / that she kepe vs fro the deuyll / And that we may by her come to the glorye of heuen To the whyche brynge vs the fader / the sone / and the holy ghoost amen / •re / & other werke to this concepcion shalt thou not doo Thus endeth the anunciacion of our blessyd Lady Here begynneth the lif of saynt Seconde knyght SAynt seconde was a noble and valyaunt knyght / and gloryous martir of our lord Ihesu cryst / And suffred hys passion and was crowned wyth the palme of martirdom in cyte of Astence / by whos gloryous presence the sayd cyte was enbelisshyd and for a synguler patron ēnoblysshid And thys holy man seconde was enformed / in the fayth of the blessyd mā Calatero whyche was holden in pryson by the prouoste Sapryce in the sayd cyte of Astence / And whan marcianus was holden in pryson in the cyte of tredonence / Sapryce the prouost wold goo thyder for to make hym do sacrefyse And saynt seconde moche desiryng to see saynt marcyane wente wyth hym / as it had ben by cause of Solace / And anone as they were out of the cyte of Altence / a whyte douue descended vpon saynt secondes heed / To whom sapryce sayd / See seconde how our goddes loue the / whyche sende byrdes fro heuē to vysite the / And whan they cam to the ryuer of tanagre saynt seconde sawe thangele of god goyng vpon the flood and sayeng to hym / Seconde see that thou haue ferme fayth / and thus shalt thou goo aboue them that worsh sayd / brother seconde / I here the goddes spekyng to the / To whom saconde sayd / late vs walke vnto the desyres of our herte / And whan they cam to another flood that hyght buryn / that same angel aforesayd saide / Seconde byleuest thou in god / or parauenture thou doubtest / To whom seconde sayd / I byleue veryly the trouthe of hys passion / Thenne sayd Sapryce / what is that I here / And seconde sayd nothyng / whan they shold entre in to trydone / by the comādement of the angele / Marcianus yssued out of pryson and appierid to seconde sayeng / Seconde entre in to the waye of trouthe / and receyue the victorye of fayth / Sapryce sayd who is he that speketh to vs as it were in a dreme / To whom Seconde sayd / it may be wel to the a dreme / but to me it is Admonicion and a comforte / After thys seconde wente to melane / And the angele of god brought faustyn & Ionathan whyche were holden in prison out of the cyte to seconde / And of them he receyued baptesme / And a cloude mynystred water for to baptyse hym wyth / And sodenly a douue descended fro heuen bryngyng vnto faustyn and Ionatyn the blessyd sacrament / And faustyn delyuerd it to seconde for to bere it to marciane / Thenne seconde retorned whan it was nyght / & wēte to the Ryuer named pade / And the angele of our lord toke the brydle of the hors and ledde hym ouer the Ryuer / & ladde hym vnto trydone / and sette hym in the prysone where marciane was / And seconde delyuerd to marciane the yefte that faustyn had sente to hym / And receyuyng it sayd / the blessid body of our lord Ihesu cryste be wyth me in to euerlastyng lyf / ¶Thenne by the comandement of thangele / Seconde wente out of pryson and wente vnto hys lodgyng / ¶ After thys marciane receyued sentence to haue hys heed smeton of / And so it was don / And thenne seconde toke hys body and buryed it / And whan sapryce herd herof he dyde do calle seconde to hym and sayd / By thys that I see the doo / I see wel that thou art a crysten man / To whom seconde

lyf of saynt Seconde martir Here begynneth the lyf of Marie Egypciaca MArye the Egypcien whyche was called a synnar / ledde and lyuyd the most strayt lyf and sharp that myght be xlvij yere in deserte / In that tyme was a good holy and relegious monke named zozimas and wente thurgh the deserte whyche lyeth by yonde the flome Iordan / And moch desired to fynde som̄e holy fadres / And whan he cam fer and depe in the deserte / he fonde a creature which was all black ouer all her body of the grete hete and brennyng of the sonne / whyche wente in that deserte / And that was thys marye egypciaca aforsaid / But assone as she sawe Zozimas come / she fledde and Zozimas after / And she taryed And sayd / Abbote Zozimas wherfore folowest thou me / haue pyte and mercy on me / For I dar not torne my face toward the by cause I am a woman & also naked / but caste thy mantel vpon me / by whyche I may thenne without shame loke and speke wyth the / And whan Zozimas herd hym self named he was gretly

fader spare me therof / For yf I shold recoūte myn estate / ye shold flee away fro me / like as fro a venymous serpente / And thy holy eeres shold be made fowle of my wordes / And the ayer shold be ful & fowl of corrupcion / and whan she sawe that Zozimas wold not be satisfyed so / Thenne she sayd / Fayr fader I was born in Egypte / and whan I was in the age of xij yere I wente in to Alexandrye / And there I gaf my body openly to synne by the space of xvij yere / and abandouned it to lecherye and refused noman / After it happed that men of that contre / wēte for adoure and worshippe the

syres I haue nothyng to paye you wyth / but I abandonne my body to doo wyth alle your playsir for my passage / & they toke me by that condicion / & whan I was come in to Iherusalem vnto the entree of the chyrche for to worshyppe the holy crosse with the other I was sodenly & Inuysibly put a back many tymes / in suche wyse that I myght not entre in to the chirche / And thēne I retorned & thoughte

promysyng to forsake the world / And fro than forthon to lyue chaast / whan I hadde thus prayd / and to our blessyd lady thus faythfully promysid / I wente agayn to the dores of the chyrche / And wythout ony Impedyment I entred in to the chyrche / And whan I had deuoutly worshypped and adoured the holy crosse / A man gaf to me iij pens / of whyche I bought thre loues of breed And after I herd anon a voys yf thou wylt passe and goo ouer slome Iordan thou shalt be sauf / And thenne I passed Iordan and cam in to thys deserte / where I neuer saw man by the space of xvij yere / Thyse thre loues that I bare wyth me bycam hard by the drought of the tyme as a stone / of whyche I toke my sustynaunce / and suffysed to me xvij yere / And after I ete herbes / my clothes ben Roten longe syth / And

that other syde the holy woman / which made the sygne of the crosse vpon the water / and wente on hit / and came ouer to hym / Whan Zozymas saw this myracle / anone he fyl doun to the feet of the holy woman / for to doo to hyr honour and reuerence / but she forbad and deffended hym and sayd / Thus oughtest thou not to doo / For thou art a preest and berest the holy sacramente the whiche she receyued in ryght grete deuocion / and sayd in wepyng / lord god please hit to the to receyue me in pees / For myn eyen hath seen my sauyour / how wel that she had alwey wept and shedde teerys so

& anone after she made the sygne of the crosse vpon the ryuere / and passed ouer the water with drye feet / as she tofore came And Zozymas wente ageyn to hys abbey / But he repented moche that he had not demaunded the name of the woman / And after the yere passed he came ageyn to the deserte like as he had promysed to thys holy woman / And he founde hyr deed / and the body ordynatly leyed as hyt shold be beryed / Zozymas began thenne anone tenderly to wepe / & durst not approche ne touche the body / but sayd to hym self I wold gladly berye this holy body yf I knewe that I shold not dysplese hyr / And whan he was in thys thought / he sawe lyeng by hyr heed a letter that sayd in this manere / Zozymas burye right here the body of the poure marye / and rendre to the erthe his ryght / and praye to god for me / At whos commaundemente the second day after I receyued hym / he called me fro thys world / Thenne zozymas was moche glad that knewe the name of the saynt / But he was gretely esmayed how he myght burye the body / For he had no thynge for to delue therthe wyth / And anone he sawe the erthe doluen & a sepulture made by a lyon that came thyder / And thenne Zozymas buryed hyr

dedes and in wordes / Or Ambrose may be sayd of Ambre and syos / whiche is as moche to saye as god / For Ambrose is as moche to say as ambre of god / For ambrose felt god in hym / & god was smellyd and odoured by hym oueralle where as he was / Or he was sayd of Ambor in greek which is to say as fader of light & of syor that is a lytel chylde / that is a fader of many sones by spyrytuell generacion / clere and ful of light in exposicion of holy scripture / and was lytel in hys humble conuersacion / Or thus as is sayd in the glosayre / Ambrose is odoure and sauoure celestyall he was odour of heuen by grete renommee smellyng / sauour by contemplacion wythin hym / An hony combe by swete exposicion of scriptures / mete of Aungels by hys glorious lyf / And paulynus bisshop of volusian wrote his lyf vnto Saynt Austyn / ¶Of the lyf of saynt Ambrose SAynt Ambrose was sone of Ambrose prouoste of rome / of whome it happed as he laye in his cradell in the halle of the pretoire there came a swarme of bees whiche fyl on his vysage and his mowth and after they departed and flewe vp in the eyre so hye that they myght not be seen / whan thys was doon the fader whiche was herof esmayed said yf this chylde lyue there shal be somme grete thynge of hym / After whan he was a lytel growen he behelde his moder and his suster whiche was a sacred virgyn kysse the preestes honde whan they offred / And he playeng with his suster put forthe his honde for to kysse / and sayd / that so behoued hir to do to hym And she not vnderstondyng hym refused hit / After he was sette to scole at Rome / & becam to be so good a clerke that he determyned the causes of the paleys / And therfore valentynyen the emperour delyuerd hym to gouerne two prouynces named / lygurye / and Emylye / Thenne whan he came in to melane it happed that the bysshop was deed / And the peple were assembled to prouyde for another / but bytwene the Arryens and the good cristen men for the eleccion fyl a grete sedycion & dyscorde And ambrose for to pease this sedicion wente thyder / and the voys of a chylde was herde / sayeng Ambrose oughte to be bysshop / and anone alle the people accorded therto hooly and began for to crye / Ambrose / Ambrose / But ambrose deffended as moche as he myght / and alle waye the peple cryed Ambrose / Thenne for to make the peple sece / he went out of the chyrche / and wente vp on a scaffolde and made the people to be beten ageynst the vsage & custome for to lette them that they shold name hym nomore / But yet they lefte not for al that / but the peple said thy synne be vpon vs / Thenne he beyng so troubled wente home / and suffryd comm shold reuoke theyr eleccion / but for al that / they cryed as they dyd to fore / and sayd thy synnes be vpon vs Whan saint ambrose saw that he myght not empesshe the eleccion he fled awaye but the peple awayted vpon hym / and toke hym at thyssue of the gate / and kepte hym so longe tyl they had graūte of themperour / and whan themperour knewe herof he had grete ioye / bycause that the Iuge that he had sente for the prouynces / was chosen to be theyr bysshop / And also he was glad by cause his worde was accomplisshed / for the Emperour sayd to Ambrose whan sente hym thyder / goo sayd he & abyde not there as a Iuge / but as a bysshop Saynt ambrose in the mene whyle that they abode the answere of themperour / fledde yet awaye / but he was taken ageyn / and was baptyzed / for he was not tofore baptyzed / how Wel that he was crysten in wylle / And the viij day after he was consecrate & stalled bysshop of melan / And foure yere after that he wente to Rome / and there his suster the vyrgyn kyssed his honde as of a preest / and he smylyng sayd lo as I tolde the / now thou kyssest my honde as of a preest / It happed after that whan saynt Ambrose Wente to another cytee to theleccion of a bysshop Iustyn the emperesse / and other of the secte of tharryens wold not consente to the good crysten men / But wold haue one of theyr secte / Thenne one of the vyrgyns of themperesse moche fayre toke saynt ambrose & drewe hym by his vestementes / and wold haue made hym to be beten / by cause he wold not holde the partye of the wymmen / Thenne saynt ambrose sayd to hyr yf I be not worthy to be a bysshop / yet thou oughtest not to laye honde vpon me / ne none other bysshop thou hast layed honde on me / thou oughtest moche redoubte and drede the Iugemente of god / And therfore god confermyd his sentence on hyr / For the nexte day she was born to her graue and was deed / Thus was she rewarded for the vylonye that she had done / And al the other were thereby sore aferde / After this whan he was retorned to melan / he suffred many assaultes and persecucions of the emperesse Iustyn / For she moeued by yeftes and by honoure moche people ageynste saynt ambrose / and many there were that enforced them to sende hym in exyle / And emonge al other there was one mounted in so grete madnesse and furour ageynst hym / that he hyred hym an hows by the chyrche / by cause he wold haue therin a carte for to sette saynt ambrose theron / and lede hym in to exyle / but that same fyl to hym For he hym self was sente in exyle in the same carte / the same day that he wold haue ledde aweye saynt ambrose / To whom yet saint ambrose dyd good for euyl / for he mynystred to hym hys costes & necessaryes / Saynt ambrose also establysshed in the chirche songe & offyces at melane fyrst / There were at that tyme in melane many men vexyd & bysette with deuyls which cryed with hye voys that saynt ambrose tormented them thus / but themperesse Iustyn and tharryens said / that said ambrose made them to say so for mony that he gafe to them / Thenne it happed that one of the arryens was out of his mynde & sayd thus / be they alle tormented as I am that consente not to saynt ambr drowned hym in a depe pyscyne or pytte / There was another heretyke and an arryen a sharpe and so harde that he was Inconuertyble by cause no man myght conuerte hym to the faythe / On a tyme he herde saynt ambrose preche / and he sawe at his ere an aungel that tolde hym al that he prechyd / and whan he had apperceyued this / he began to susteyn the feythe to whiche he had ben contrarye / After this it happed that one enchauntour called deuyls to hym / & sente them to saynt ambrose for to ennoye & greue hym / but the deuyls retorned and sayd that they might not approche to his yate by cause ther was a grete fyre al about his hows / and this enchauntour after Whan he was tormented of the prouost for certeyn trespaces / he cryed and said that he was tormēted of saynt ambrose There was a man that had a deuyll wythin hym / And after wente to melane / and anone as he entred the cytee the deuyl lefte hym / and assone as he wente out of the cytee the deuyl reentred in hym ageyn / thenne he demaunded hym why he dyd so / & he answerd by cause he was aferde of ambrose / after it happed that a man beyng conducte & hyred of Iustyn themperesse came to the beddes syde of saynt ambrose / & Wold haue put & ryuen his swerde thorugh his body / but anone his arme was dryed vp / Another was vexed With a deuyl said that saynt ambrose tormented hym / but saynt ambrose made hym to be stylle / for ambrose tormenteth none but that doth thennye of the / for thou seest men assēde fro wh u art fallen And that is it whiche tormenteth the For ambrose can not be so blowen and wo llen as thou arte / Thenne was he stylle and spake not / whan saynt ambrose wente in the towne / he sawe a man laughe by cause he sawe another falle / thenne said ambrose to hym thou that laughest / beware that thou falle not also / and after he fylle / and thus was he taughte that he shold not mocque his felawe / On a tyme Saynt Ambrose wente vnto the paleys for to praye for a poure man / but the Iuge made to close the gate that he myght not entre in / Thenne saint ambrose said thou shalt come for to entre in to the chyrche / but thou shalt not entre / and yet shal the yates be opene / And so it happed that after the Iuge doubted his enemyes / & wente to the chyrche / but he myght not entre in / and yet the yates were opene / •e •n wymmen to

/ he wepte so bytterly that he wold make the synnar to wepe / He was of so grete doubte / that whan hyt was tolde to hym of the dethe of ony bysshop / he wold wepe soo sore / that vnnethe he myght be comforted / And whan it was demaunded hym why he wepte for the dethe of good men / For he oughte better to make ioye by cause they wente to heuen / thenne he answerd I wepe not bycause they goo tofore me but bycause that vnnethe and wyth grete payne may ony be foūde for to doo wel suche offyces / he was of soo grete stedfanesse and so establysshed in hys purpoos / that he wold not leue for drede ne for greef that myght be doon to hym / to repreue themperour / ne the other grete men whan they dyd thynges that they ought not to doo / ne he wold flatre no man / There was broughte ones tofore hym a man / whiche was greuously mysmade / Thenne sayd saynt ambrose / the body must be delyuerd to the deuyll / And that the flesshe goo to the dethe / by whyche the spyrite may be saued / vnnethe was the worde out of hys mowthe / but the deuyl began to tormente hym / After as it is sayd on a tyme he wente to rome & whan he was on a tyme by the waye herberowed wyth a ryche man / Saynt ambrose began to demaunde hym of his estate / that ryche man answerd / Syr myn estate is happy ynough and gloryous / For I haue rychesses ynough / seruauntes / varlettes / chyldren / neuewes / cosyns / frendes / and kynnysmen whiche serue me / and al my werkes and besoynyes come to my wylle ne I haue neuer thynge that may angre ne trowble me / Thenne sayd saynt Ambrose to them that were wyth hym Flee we hens for our lord god is not here / haste you fayre chyldren / haste you and lete vs abyde here no lengyr / leste the vengeaunce of god take vs / & that we be not wrapped in the synnes of these peple / They departed & fledde anone / but they were not goon ferre but that the erthe opened & swolowed in alle the hows of this ryche man / & there abode not as moche as the steppe of hym self ne of al that euer he had / Thenne said saynt ambrose be holde fa god dothe to them that haue aduersyte in thys world / & how wrothe he is to them that haue the welthe and rychesses of thys world / Of whyche thynge apyereth yet the pytte or f and specyally in grete men / and in them that were in moste grete estate whiche solde al for money / and wyth the mynystres of the chirche he sawe symonye reygne / he began to praye to god / that he wold take hym aweye fro the myseryes of thys world And he Impetred that which he desyred Thenne he called his felawshyp & sayd to them in ioyeng / that he shold abyde with them vnto the resurrexyon of our lord / and a lytel tofore that he laye seke / as he expownded to hys notarye the xliiij psalme / Sodaynlye in the presence & sight of his notary a fyre in the manere of a shelde couerd his heed and entryd in to his mouthe / Thenne became his face as wghyte as ony snowe / & anone after hit came ageyn to his fyrst fourme / And that day he lefte his wrytyng and endytyng / Thenne began his maladye to greue hym / and the erle of ytalye whyche was thenne at mylane called the gentyl men of the contree & sayd to them that yf so grete and good a man shold goo fro them it shold be grete pyte / & grete parelle to alle ytalye / and sayd to them that they alle shold goo with hym to thys holy man / and praye hym that he wold gete graunte of our lord of space and lenger lyf / whan saynt ambrose had herde theyr requeste / He answerd / fayre sones I haue not so lyued emonge you / that I am ashamed to lyue yf hit plese god / ne I haue no fere ne drede of dethe / for we haue a good lord / In this tyme assemblyd his foure dekens / and began to trete who shold be a good bisshop after hym And they named secretely emonge them self / that vnnethe they them self herde hit Symplycien / Saynt ambrose was ferre fro them / they wende that he myght not haue herde them / And he cryed on hye thryes he is olde / and he is good / whan they herde hym they were moche abasshed / and departed / And syth after his deth they chase the same symplicien / for the good wytnesse that saynt ambrose had borne of hym / A bysshop whiche was named honorius that abode the deth of saynt ambrose slepte / and herde a voys that thryes called hym and sayd / aryse thou vp for he shal goo his waye anone / Thenne he aroos anone hastely & went to melane / and gaue to hym the holy sacramente / the precious body of our lord / And anone saynt ambrose leyde his armes in fourme of a crosse / and made his prayers / and so departed and gaue vp his ghoost emonge the wordes of his prayers / aboute the yere of our lord thre hondred lxxx / the vygyle of ester / and whan his body in the nyght was borne in to the chyrche / many children that were baptyzed sawe hym as they sayd syttyng in a chayer honowrably / and other shewed hym wyth theyr fyngres to theyr fader and other And somme sayd that they sawe a sterre vpon his body / There was a preest that satte at mete wyth other / whiche sayd not wel of hym / but myssayed / but anone god so chastysed hym that he was borne fro the table / & deyed anone after / In the cyte of cartage were thre bysshoppes to gyder at dyner and one of them spake euyl by detraccyon of saynt ambrose / And there was a man that tolde what was befallen for suche langage to this forsaid preest but he mocqued and iaped so moche / that he felte a stroke mortal that / that same day he deyed and was buryed / It is founden wryten in a cronycle that the Emperour valentynyen was wrothe bycause that in the cyte of thessalonyke the peple had stoned to deth his Iuges / that were sente thyder in his name / and for tauenge the same the emperour dyd doo slee v thousand persones grete and lytel / good & euyl & as wel them that had not trespaced as

the wyth / For hit is gyuen to the in waye of medecyne / Whan the Emperour herde thyse wordes he was obedyent / and began to wayle and wepe / And retorned in to his paleys / and abode there longe wepyng / Thenne Ruffyn the mayster of his knyghtes demaunded wherfore he so sorewed and Wepte / and he answerd Ruffyn thou knowest not my sorowes / for I see that seruauntes and poure beggers may entre in to the chirche / but I may not entre / For ambrose hath excomyned me And he sayeng this at euery word he syghed / Thenne sayd ruffyn to hym yf thou wylt I shal make hym anone to assoyle the / He answerd thou mayst not / For Ambrose doubteth not the force ne the power of the Emperour / To thende that he holde fermely the lawe of god / And whan Ruffyn said more and more that he shold make hym enclyne to assoyle hym / Thenne he sent hym to Ambrose / And the Emperour folowed sone after moche humbly / Whan Saynt Ambrose sawe Ruffyn come / he sayd to hym thou hast no more shame thenne an

fonde the stake grene and bare leuys / And whan they sawe thys grete myracle / they beleued in god / & kyssed the feet of this holy saynt / and repented them ful sore of theyr wycked dedes / and cryed ful mekely god mercy and thys holy saynt Alphey / And after he was broughte to london wyth grete worshyp / and buryed in the chirche of Saynt Paule with grete reuerence / And there hys body laye buryed many yere / And afterward hit was taken vp and translated to caunterburye / and his bones there leyed in a worshypful fiertre or shryne / where our lord sheweth dayly many fayre myracles / for his holy marter Saynt Alphey / And the tormentours that repentyd them not / deyed anone after in grete myserye in dyuerse wyses for to be punysshed as hit plesyd our lord / ¶ Thenne lete vs praye to

He was a pylgrym in the sight of the World / and he was cutte and detrenched by the crowne of martirdom and he was a good counceyllour in prechyng / And his legende is nombred emonge other scriptures

were assemblid for to slee hym / And whan they sawe hym they fledde / And whan he came nyghe the cytee / he venymed the peple wyth his breeth / And therfore the peple of the cytee gaue to hym euery day two sheep for to fede hym / by cause he shold doo no harme to the peple / And whan the sheep fayled there was taken a man and a sheep / Thenne was an ordenaunce made in the towne / that there shold be taken the chyldren and yonge peple of them of the towne by lotte / And eueryche as it fyl were he gentil or poure shold be delyuerd whan the lotte fyl on hym or hyr / So it happed that many

araye his doughter / lyke as she shold be wedded / and enbraced hyr kyssed hir and gaue hir his benedyccion / And after ledde hyr to the place where the dragon was / whan she was there / saynt george passed by / And whan he sawe the lady / he demaunded the lady what she made there / And she sayd / goo ye your waye fayre yonge man / that ye perysshe not also / Thenne sayd he telle to me what haue ye / and why ye wepe / and doubte ye of no thynge / whan she sawe that he wold knowe she sayd to hym how she was delyuerd to the dragon / Thenne sayd saynt george / Fayre doughter doubte ye no thynge herof / For I shall helpe the in the name of Ihesu Cryste / She said for goddes sake good knyght goo your waye / and abyde not wyth me / for ye may not delyuer me / Thus as they spake to gyder the dragon apperyd & came rennyng to them and saynt George was vpon his hors & drewe out his swerde & garnysshed hym wyth the signe of the crosse / and rode hardely ageynst the dragon which came toward hym and smote hym with his spere and hurte hym sore & threwe hym to the grounde / And after sayd to the mayde / delyuer to me your gyrdel and bynde hit about the necke of the dragon / and be not

alas / we shal be alle deed / Thenne saynt George sayd to them / ne doubte ye no thynge / wythout more byleue ye in god Ihesu cryste / and doo you to be baptysed / and I shal slee the dragon / Thenne the kyng was baptysed and al his peple / and saynt george slewe the dragon and smote of his heed / And commaunded thathe shold be throwen in the feldes / and they took iiij cartes wyth oxen that drewe hym out of the cyte / ¶Thenne were there wel fystene thousand men baptised without wymmen and chyldren / And the kyng dyd doo make a chirche there of our lady and of saynt George / In the whiche yet sourdeth a founteyn of lyuyng water whiche heleth seek peple that drynke therof / After this the kyng offred to Saint george as moche money as there myght be nombred / but he refused alle and commaunded that it shold be gyuen to poure peple for goddes sake / and enioyned the kynge iiij thynges / that is / that he shold haue charge of the chyrches / and that he shold honoure the preestes / and here theyr seruyce dylygently / and that he shold haue pyte on the poure peple / And after kyssed the kyng and departed / Now hit happed that in the tyme of dyoclesyen and maxymyen whyche were Emperours / was soo grete persecucion of crysten men / that wythin a moneth were marterd wel xxij / thousand / And therfore they had soo grete drede that somme renyed and forsoke god and dyd sacrefyse

appyeryd he dyd doo frote wyth salte / And soo sente hym in to pryson / but our loord appyered to hym the same nyght wyth grete lyght and comforted hym moche swetely / And by this grete consolacion he took to hym soo good herte / that he doubted no tormēt that they myght make hym suffre / Thenne whan dacian the prouost sawe that he myght not surmounte hym / he called hys enchaunter and sayd to hym / I see that these cristen peple doubte not our tormentes / Thenchaūtour bonde hym self vpon his heed to be smyten of / yf he ouercome not his craftes / Thenne he dyd take stronge venym and medled hyt wyth wyne / and made Inuocacion of the names of his false goddes / and gafe hyt to Saynt George to drynke / Saynt george took hit and made the signe of the crosse on hit / and anone dranke it without greuyng hym ony thynge / Thenne the Enchaunteur made it more stronger than hit was tofore of venym and gaue it hym to drynke / And hit greuyd hym no thynge / whan the enchaunteur sawe that / he knelyd doun at the feet of saynt george / and prayed hym that he wold make hym crysten / And whan dacyen knewe that he was becomen crysten / he made to smyte of his heed / And after on the morne he made saynt George to be sette betwene two wheles whiche were ful of swerdes sharpe and cuttyng on bothe sydes But anone the wheles were broken / & Saynt george escaped wythout hurte And thenne commaunded dacian that they shold put hym in a cawdren full of molten leed / & whan saynt george entred therin / by the vertu of our lord hym semed that he was in a bayne wel at ease / Thenne dacyen seyng thys / began to aswage his yre and to flatre hym by fayre wordes / and said to hym George the pacyence of our goddes is ouer grete vnto the / whiche hast blasphemyd them / and done to them grete despyte / thenne fayre and right swete sone / I praye the that thou retorne to our lawe and make sacrefyse to the ydolles / and leue thy folye / and I shal enhaunce the to grete honour and worshyp / Thenne began saynt George to smyle and sayd to hym / wherfore saydest thou not to me thus at the begynnyng / I am redy to do as thou sayest / Thenne was dacyan gladde / and made to crye ouer alle the towne that alle the peple shold assemble for to see George make sacrefyse / which so moche had stryued there ageynst / Thenne was the cyte arayed / and feste thorugh out al the towne / and al came to the temple for to see hym / whan saynt George was on his knees / and they supposed that he wold haue worshypped thydolles / he prayed our lord god of heuen that he wold destroye the temple and thydolle in the honoure of his name / For to make the peple to be conuerted / And anone the fyre descended fro heuen and brente the temple and thydolles and theyr preestes / And sythe the erthe opened and swalowed alle the cendres and asshes that were lefte / Thenne dacien made hym to be broughte tofore hym and sayd to hym / what ben the euyl dedes that thou hast doon / and also grete vntrouthe / Thenne sayd to hym saynt george / A syr beleue it not / but come wyth me & see how I shal sacrefye / Thenne sayd dacyan to hym / I see wel thy frawde & thy barate / thou wylt make the erthe to swalowe

sayd to hys wyf / I shal deye for angre yf I may not surmounte and ouercome thys man / Thenne sayd she to hym euyl and cruel tyraunt ne seest thou not the grete vertue of the crysten peple I sayd to

and he dyd soo / and anone they fonde londe in an yle / and by al the ryuages where as they passed / it was sayd to them that they were wel happy that they ledde so noble a tresoure as the body of Saynt marke / and prayed them that they wold lete them worshyp hit / yet there was a marōner that myght not byleue that it was the body of Saynt Marke but the deuyl entred in to hym / and tormented hym soo longe that he coude not be delyuerd tyl he was brought to the holy body / and assone as he confessyd / that hit was the body of Saynt marke / he was delyuerd of the wycked spyryte / And euer after he had grete deuocion to saynt marke It happed after that the body of saint marke was closed in a pyler of marble and right fewe people knewe therof by cause it shold be secretely kepte / Thenne it happed that they that knewe therof deyed / and there was none that knewe where this grete tresour myght be / wherfore the clerkes and the laye peple were gretely dyscomforted and wepte for sorowe / and doubted moche that it had be stolen awaye / Thenne made they solempne processyons and letanyes / and the peple began to faste & be in prayers / And al sodeynly the stones opened & shewed to alle

for they supposed that he shold not gete hit specially by cause the eyre was so clere / and no clowde was seen / and the crysten men doubted / that theyr feythe myght there by come to confusyon / but the bysshop the heretyke wold not bynde hym therto / Saynt peter had good feythe and truste in god / and made his prayer openlye that he wold conueye ouer them a clowde / and he made the sygne of the

whiche late hath shedde his blood for the feyth / for he hath helyd the of the blood that ranne fro the And whan he awoke he purposed to vysyte the sepulcre of Saynt Peter / There was a countesse of the castel cassyn whiche had special deuocyon to saynt Peter / and fasted alweye his vygyl / Now it happed that she offred a candell to thaulter of saynt peter / and anone the preest for his couetise quenchyd the candel / but anone after the candel was lyhht ageyn by hym self / & he quenched it ageyn ones or twyes & alle weye as sone as he was gone it lighted anone ageyn / thenne he lefte that & put out another candel which a knyght had offred in thonour of saynt peter / whiche knyghte fasted also hys euen / and the preest assayed ij tymes yf he myght put it out / but he myght not / Thenne said the knyght vnto the preest / what deuyl seest thou not well the myracle / that saynt Peter wyl not that they be quenchyd / Thenne was the preest abasshed & all the clerkes that were there with

that they shold retorne / & they had supposed that roba had sayd so / & retorned / and after anone he began to crye ageyn / thenne apperceyued they wel / that they Were the deuyls / & fette the preest which coniured in the name of saynt Peter the deuyls that they shold goo their waye / Thenne two of them wente awaye / and the thyrd abode / & his frendes brought hym on the morne to the chyrche of

suche caas that he myght not speke / Thenne the other heretykes fledde al confused / and the good cristen men thanked our lord The day that saynt peter was marterd a nonne that was of the cite of florence sawe in a vysyon our lady that styed vp in to heuen & with her two persones one on the ryght syde & that other on the lyfte in the habyte of freres whiche weren by hir / & whan she demaunded who it was / A voys said to hyr that it was the sowle of saynt Peter / And was founden certeynly that same day he suffred deth / & therfore thys Nonne whiche was grouously seek prayed to saynt peter for to recouer her helthe / and he gate it for hir entyerly / There was a scoler that wente fro maloygne vnto monpellyer / & in lepyng he was broken that he myght not goo / Thenne he remembryd of a

In the cyte of compostelle there was a man that had grete leggys swollen lyke a barelle / & his wombe lyke a woman with chylde and his face foule & horryble / so that he semed a monstre to loke on / and it happed that he wente with a staffe beggyng his breed / and in a place where he demaundd on a tyme almesse of a good woman / she sawe hym so swollen that she said that it were better for hym to

whiche wold constrayne hym to make sacrefise to ydolles whiche was called mars theyr god / & anone vnder thydol yssued out a right grete dragon / whiche forthwith slewe the bysshoppes sone that apoynted the fyre for to make the sacrefyse / & the ij prouostes also / whos seruaūtes helde saint phylip in yron bondes / and the dragon corrupted the peple with his breethe / that they al were seek

after this the paynyms toke & helde hym / & fastenyd hym to the crosse / like vnto hys mayster / & so he yelded vp his sowle & deyed / & his body was worshypfully buryed there / & his ij doughters deyed longe after hym / and were also buryed that one on the right syde & that other on the lyfte syde of the body of their fader / Ysodore writeth in the book of the lyf & deth of sayntes & saith that philip preched to the frensshmen & to men that were in derkenes / he enlighted them in the feyth / after be was taken in the cite of Iherapolym of the paynyms and of them stoned & crucefyed / of

weyght of god / or Iames may be said of Iaculo a darte & cope smytyng / which is to say smeten with a darte / or smeten with glayues / he was said a supplantour of the world / for he despysed hit / in supplantyng the feste / for he supplanted the deuyl / & he is said makyng redy / for alweye he made redy his body to do wel / for as gregore of nycene saith / we haue in vs thre euyl passyons / whiche

exercitacion of vertues / he was smeten wyth glayues by marterdom / ¶Of saynt Iames the lasse IAmes the appostle is said the lasse / how wel that he was elder of age than was Saynt Iames the more / by cause lyke as is in relygyon / he that entred fyrst is called ayne / and grete / & he that cometh after shal be called lasse though he be the older / and in this wyse was thys saynt Iames called the lasse / he was called also the broder of our lord / by cause he resembled moche wel our lord in body in vysage / and of manere he was called Iames the Iuste for his right grete holynesse / Far saint Iherome recordeth that he was so holy that the peple s called Iames the sone of alphey / this Iames was euer holy after that he yssued out of his moders wombe / he neuer dranke wyne / mede / ne sydre ne neuer ete flesshe / ne neuer rasour touched his heed ne he neuer baygned / he knelyd so ofte in prayers / that his knees were as harde as the horne of a camel / he sange in Iherusalem the fyrst masse that euer was songe therin / & he was fyrst bysshop of Iherusalem / Ioseph recordeth that he had auowed at the deth of our lord that he wold neuer ete tyl our lord were rysen fro deth to lyf / thēne on ester day our lord apperid to hym & said / and gaue it to hym / The seuenth yere after the appostles assembled in Ierusalem on ester day / there saynt Iames demaundyng what god had done by them tofore the peple / that they shold telle / and whan saynt Iames had preched seuen dayes in the temple with the other appostles / Cayphas and somme other wold haue ben baptyzed / And thenne entryd in a man sodeynly in to the temple and said cryeng / O ye syrres what wyl ye doo / why suffre ye thus to be dysceyued of thyse enchauntours / be ye ware & kepe you that they dysceyue you not / he moeuyd so moche the people that they wold haue stoned the appostles / Thenne thys felowe wente vp to the lectron where as saynt Iames preched and threwe hym doun bacwarde / and fro thenne forthon euer after he halted And thys was doon the vij yere after the ascencion of our lord / And he was bysshop there by the space of xxx yere And in his xxx yere whan the Iewes sawe that they myght not slee Saynt Poule / bycause he had appeled to the Emperour to Rome / and was sente forthe to Rome / they torned al theyr persecusyon ageynst saynt Iames / and sayd to hym the peple is dysceyued / for they supposed that your Ihesus were messyas / Thenne for as moche as thou arte moche byleuyd / we praye the that thou assemble the peple / and that thou stonde vp on hye / and shewe to them that it is not he / For thou arte so iuste that We alle shal byleue in the / Thenne saynt Iames wente vp on the fronte of the temple on ester day / and alle the peple were assembled bynethe Thenne sayde the Iewes to hym wyth an hye voys / Right Iuste & trewe man we knowe wel that thou shalt not lye Shewe to vs of Ihesus that was hanged vpon the crosse that whiche thou knowest / for al the world is dysceyued / Thenne answerd he with an hye voys / wherfore demaunde ye me of the sone of the vyrgyn / I say to you that he is now in heuen and sytteth on the ryght syde of god the fader / and shall come deme the lyuyng and the deed / whan the crysten men had herde hym / they were moche glad / But the pharysees and the maysters of the lawe repented them of thys / that they had made hym to say and bere this witnesse tofore the people / And toke counceyll to gydre / for to caste hym doun / for to make the people aferde / by cause they shold not byleue hym / and they cryed O the Iuste man hath erryd at thys tyme / and after they threwe hym doun and the peple began to stone hym / but he was on his knees and sayd / Fayre lord god pardone them / for they wote not what they doo / Thenne escryed one of the sonnes of the preest named Iacob / Syres leue ye this iuste man in pees / but there was a man in that companye toke a fullers staffe / and smote hym on the heed / that his brayne fyl alle abrode / And thus by marterdom he fynysshed his lyf / and was there buryed nygh vnto the temple / And the peple wold haue slayne these malefactours / bycause they had sleyne hym / but they fledde / this was done in the tyme of nero the yere of our lord lvij / ¶ Iosephus sayth that for thy grete synne of the deth of saynt Iames / Was Ierusalem afterward destroyeed / For tofore that the destruccion came / god shewed meruayllous signes / For there was a sterre right clere and shynyng / whiche had the fourme of a swerde that henge ouer Ierusalem but this token ne the tokenes hereafter folowyng / cam not onely for the deth of saynt Iames / but for the dethe of our lord Ihesu crist pryncypally / for he said ther shal not in the be left a stone vpon a stone / but bycause our lord wold not the dethe of synnars / but that he wold they shold doo penaunce and repente them / he abode fourty yere / and called them vnto penaunce by his appostles / and moste by saynt Iames broder of our lord / whiche contynuelly prechyd to them / For in thys fourty yere were many signes and prodyges shewed to them as Iosephus reherceth of which the sterre lyke the swerde was one Whiche was seen ouer the cyte an hole yere duryng & brennyng with grete bryghte flames •r•f how they myght touche the hemme of his robe or mantel / he was also 〈◊〉 the table fayr broder & ete / for the sone of the virgyn is rysen fro deth to lyfe / Thenne toke he the breed and made the benediction The nexte yere after in a feste of Ester there was a clerenesse and lyghte aboute the temple in the nyghte that it was lyke vnto clere day / In that same tyme there was a cowe brought forth to be sacrefyed / whyche anone calued or brought forth a lambe ageynst kynde / After this a litel tyme aboute goyng doun of the sonne there was seen in the eyre cartes & waynes and grete companye of men of armes that enuyronned the cytee sodaynly / In a feste of whytsontyde whyche is called penthecoste / the preestes wente in to the temple by nyght / for to doo theyr mysteryes / and they herde a voys sayeng / lete vs goo hens fro this place & iiij yere after tofore that the destruccion came / a man whos name was Ihesus the sone of ananye began to crye sodeynlye / the voys of thorryent / the voys of thoccident / the voys of foure wyndes vpon Iherusalem / woo on the husbondes / woo vpon the wyues / and woo vpon alle the people / the said man was taken smeten and beten / tormented / & broughte tofore the Iuge / and he neuer wepte ne cryed mercy / but he euer perseueryd and cryed howlyng the same wordes addyng therto / woo / woo to Iherusalem / al thys sayth Iosephus / & yet for al these tokenes warnynges & prodygis / the Iewes were neuer aferde Thēne xl yere after the passyon of our lord Ihesu cryste came titus and vaspasyanus ageynst Iherusalem & destroyed hit / The cause and by whome it was destroyed is recorded in an hystorye though hit be not autentyke / For pylate which doubted the furour & angre of themperour Tybere / bycause he had wrongfully Iuged and condempned Ihesu cryste thynnocent / sente one of his seruauntes for to excuse hym / and the seruauntes name was albane / In thys tyme vaspasyanus was gouernour of galace for themperour / And the messager of pylate whyche wolde haue gone to Rome was constrayned by a contrarye wynde to arryue in galace and was broughte to vaspasyan / For the custome of the contree was that who was taken on the see / and brought so in ageynst his wylle / shold be atte wylle of the lord body & goodes And whan vaspasyanus sawe hym he demaunded hym what he was / and fro whens he came / he sayd that he was of Iherusalem / Thenne said vaspasyan A lord god in that contre were wonte to be good maysters and moche good surgyens / my frende sayd he canst thou ony thynge of surgerye / This sayd he bycause he had in his nose a botche ful of wormes fro his yongthe / and neuer myght man be founden that myght hele hym of it / the messanger of pylate answerd & said / that he coude no thynge therof / Vaspasyan sayd yf thou hele me not I shal slee the / The messanger sayd he that enlumyned the blynde and chaced deuyls out of men / And reysed deed men to lyfe in our contree knoweth wel that I can not hele the / but he can wel hele the yf he wyl / Thenne demaunded vaspasyan what he was / he sayd to hym that it was Ihesus of nazareth / whome they of Iherusalem had sleyne wrongfully for enuye / and yf thou wylt beleue in hym he shal hele the / Thenne sayd vaspasyanus / I beleue wel that he that reysed deed men may wel hele and make me al hole / & sayeng thyse wordes the waspys fyll from his nose wyth the botche wythin whyche they were / and forthwith he was made parfytely hole / wherof he had moche grete ioye / And sayd I am certeyn that he that hath thus made me hole was the veray sone of god / I shal demaunde lycence of the emperour Tybere and I shal goo destroye the cursyd traytours / that haue sleyne thys man / And thenne he lete Alban the messager of pylate goo where he wold After thys vaspasyan wente to Rome and gate lycence of themperour for to destroye thys peple and the cyte of Ierusalem / And assembled his hoost in the tyme of nero themperour / and came sodaynly / The Iewes thenne beyng the moste parte in Iherusalem on ester day and byseged the towne / For on that day al the Iewes of the contre were comen to the feest / so that they were sodaynly enclosed / Now was it soo that tofore that vaspasyan came / the good men of the cyte were warned by the holy gooste / that they shold goo out of the cytee / And they wente to a place called pellam / bycause that the vengeaunce shold not falle on them / but on the wycked peple of the Iewes / There was another cyte of the Iurye named Ionaparam / In whiche Iosephus was duc / whiche vaspasyan first assayled / but Iosephus with suche men as he had resysted them manlye / but at the laste whan Iosephus sawe the destruccion of it and myght no lenger kepe hit / he toke wyth hym twelue Iewes / and hyd hym in a caue or an hows vnder therthe / where they were foure dayes wythout mete and drynke in grete anguysshe and affliccion / Thēne the Iewes beyng there without consente of Iosephus had leuer deye / than be subgette or put them self in seruytude to vaspasyan / And wold slee them self / and offre theyr blood in sacrefyse to god / And bycause Iosephus was the moste worthy and noble of them / they wold slee hym fyrst / by whos blood god myght best be plesed or ellys as it is sayd in the cronycle that eche of them shold slee other / rather than they shold come in to the handes of the romayns / Thenne Iosephus a prudent man / and not wyllyng to deye / constytuted and ordeyned hym self Iuge of the dethe & sacrefyse / and who that fyrst shold be slayne / he ordeyned that bytwene two and two / shold be drawen lotte / and so the lotte gyuen now one was sleyne now another / tyl at the laste al were dede saufe Iosephus and one other / Thenne Iosephus beyng a stronge man and a lyghte caughte the swerde to hym / and axed his felowe whether he had leuer lyue or deye / and commaunded hym shortely wythout delaye to telle hym / and he sore dredyng sayd I forsake not to lyue yf I may by thy grace gete and kepe my lyf / Thenne Iosephus spake to a seruaunt of vospasyan and dyd so moche that he gate his lyf of vaspasian / and thenne he was broughte to vaspasyan / and Vaspasyan sayd to hym / Thou sholdest haue deyed / yf thou haddest not goten grace by the prayer and request of this man and Iosephus answerd yf ony thynge be done amys / it may torne to better / And vaspasyan sayd who that is boūden / what may he do / Iosephus āswerd somwhat may I do yf thou wylt gyue me audyence / Vaspasyan sayd I wyl wel that thou say / & yf thou say ony good / thou shalt be pesybly herde / And Iosephus sayd the Emperour of rome is dede / and the senate hath made the emperour / and vaspasian answerd yf thou be a prophete why hast thou not prophecyed to the people of thys cytee that they shal be taken by my honde / And Iosephus sayd I haue wel xl dayes warned them / and in the mene whyle came the messagers fro rome / & affermed that vaspasyen was made emperour / and ladde hym to Rome / Alle thys recounteth Eusebyus in hys cronycle / Iosephus sayd tofore to vaspasyan as wel of the dethe of themperour / as of his eleccion to be emperour And vaspasyan lefte his sone Tytus at the syege of Iherusalem / It is redde also in the same hystorye though it be apocrypha that whan Tytus herde that his fader was enhaunced in to the empyre / he was so glad and had so moche ioye / that alle hys syne wes were shronken / and was so feble that he was sore tormented wyth the palsye / and Iosephus heryng therof dylygently enquyred the cause of the sekenesse / the tyme therof / and the manere / the cause ne the sekenes were not knowen / but the tyme was whan he herde of theleccion of his fader to the empyre / Iosephus a wyse & a prudent man consyderyd the tyme of the commyng of the sekenesse / and coniected that it came of ouermoche ioye and haboundyng gladnesse / & remembryng that contraryes ben cured by theyr contraryes / For that whiche cometh of loue / is cured by hate oftymes / And began tenquyre yf there were ony man that the prynce hated moche / And it was that he had a seruaunte whome he helde in pryson / and hated hym so moche that in no wyse he myght loke on hym ne here hym named / Thenne he sayd tyto yf thou desyre to be hole / who that euer come in my felawshyp / must be here sure and saufe / Thenne Iosephus made the dyner to be redy / and sette hym self ageynst hym and the seruaunte that tytus moste hated satte on his ryght syde / whome assone as tytus had beholden he began to chauffe and to be meruaylous angry for anguysshe / Thenne he whiche was Infrigydate and colde for ioye / stratched out his synewes and was made al hole by the brennyng hete of angre and was al hole / Alle thys forsaid of Iosephus I remytte hit to the redars Iugement whether he wyl byleue it or not / but tytus laye at the syege two yere tofore the cyte and so longe that the famyne oppressyd so sore / that the faders fro the chyldren / and the chyldren fro the faders / and husbondes fro the wyues / and wyues fro the husbondes plucked the mete out of others mowthes / And yonge men that had ben ryght stronge fyl doun dede in the stretes and wayes / they that shold burye the dede fyl doun oftymes deed vpon them that Were dede / and bycause they were not borne aweye / nor they myght not suffre the stenche of the deed bodyes / they ordeyned that the comyns of the towne shold caste them ouer the walles in to the dyches / by cause they myght not endure the stenche to burye them / And whan tytus which wente aboute the cytee sawe the dyches so ful of carryens whiche corrupted alle the contree wyth the stenche / he helde vp his houdes to heuen Wepyng and sayd lord god now see I wel / that thys is not by me / but by the whiche herein takest vengeaunce / For thenne they of the towne within had so grete defaulte that they ete theyr shoys and lachettis There was a gentyl woman in the towne whiche had a chylde to whome she gaue sowke / And for hungre that she had she strangled and slewe thys chylde / and rosted that one halfe / and kepte that other for to ete / It happed that the gouernours of the towne whiche wente to serche / smellyd the sauour of thys rooste / and brake vp the dore / and thretened to slee the woman yf she gaue to them not of her mete / Thenne she shewed to them that other dele of her chylde that she had kepte / and sayd yf he wyl / I shal gladly gyue you parte / Thenne had they so grete horrour therof / that they myght not speke / Thenne sayd she thys was my sone / the synne is myn and cometh on me / ete on hardelye / for I haue eten parte tofore / for ye loued hym not soo wel as I dyd that was his moder / & yf pyte meue you that ye leue to ete of hym / I that haue eten that one halfe / knowe ye for

destroyed al / & the temple also / And lyke as the Iewes had boughte our lord for xxx pens / So gaue he thyrty Iewes for one peny / And lyke as Iosephus recordeth / He solde so foure score and xvij thousand / And xj hondred thousand were perisshed by famyne and by swerde / It is redde that whan tytus entred Iherusalem he sawe a thycke walle / whyche he dyd doo perysshe and breke And whan an hole was made therin / they sawe there a fayre olde man / hore and venerable of chere / whome they demaunded longe what he was / At the laste he answerd and sayd he was Ioseph of abyramathya a cytre of

and of soo grete bountee / that there had none be lyke hym / For as Ierome sayth / that day that he had not gyuen a yefte / ne had done no good at euyn he sayd to his frendes / O my frendes thys day haue I loste / After this / longe tyme it happed that somme Iewes wold reedefye Iherusalem / and on the fyrst mornynge that they wente to werke / they founde crosses on the dewe / and thenne they fledde / And after they came ageyn and began to reedefye ageyn / And thenne they founde blody crosses / And thenne they fledde aweye ageyn / And the thyrd tyme they came ageyn and out of the erthe

of thys worde Inuencion THe Inuencion of the holy crosse is said bycause that this day the holy crosse was founden / for tofore it was founden of seth in paradyse terrestre / lyke as hit shal be sayd here after / and also it was founden of salamon in the moute of lybane and of the quene of saba / in the temple of salamon / And of the Iewes in the water of pyscyne / And on thys day it Was founden of Helayne in the mounte of caluarye / Of the holy crosse THe holy crosse was foūden two hondred yere after the resurrexyon of our lord / It is redde in the gospel of nychodemus / that wh Wexyd seek / Seth his sone Wente to the yate of paradise terrestre for to gete the oyle of mercy for to enoynte wyth al his faders body / Thenne apperid to hym saynt mychel thaungel & sayd to hym / traueyle not the in vayne / for this oyle / for thou mayst not haue it tyl fyue thousand and fyue hondred yere been passed / how be it that fro Adam vnto the passyon of our lord were but fyue MC and xxxiij yere / In another place it is redde that the aungel broughte hym a braunche / and commaunded hym to plante it in the mounte of lybanye / Yet fynde we in another place / that he gafe to hym of the tree that Adam etc of / And sayd to hym that whan that bare fruyte he shold be guarysshed and alle hoole / Whan seth came ageyn he founde his fader deed / & planted this tree vpon his graue / And it endured there vnto the tyme of Salamon / and by cause he sawe that it was fayre he dyd doo hewe it doun / and sette it in his hows named saltus / and whan the quene of saba came to vysyte Salamon / She worshypped this tree by cause she sayd the sauyour of alle the world shold be hanged theron / by whome the royame of the Iewes shal be defaced and seace Salamon for this cause made hit to be taken vp / & doluen depe in the grounde Now it happed after that they of Ierusalem / dyd do make a grete pytte for a pyscyne / where as the mynystters of the temple shold Wesshe theyr bestys / that they shold sacrefyse / & there foūde thys tree / and thys pyscyne had suche vertue / that the aungels descended and meuyd the water / and the first seek man that descendyd in to the water after the meuyng / was made hole of what someuer sekenesse he was seek of And whan the tyme approched of the passyon of our lord / thys tree aroos out of the water and floted aboue the water / And of this pyece of tymbre made the Iewes the crosse of our lord / Thenne after this hystorye / the crosse by whiche we been saued / came of the tree by whiche we were dampned / And the water of that pyscyne had not his vertue onely of the aungel / but of the tre / Wyth this tre wherof the crosse was maad / there was a tree that wente ouerthwarte / on whiche the armes of our lord were nayled / And another pyece aboue whiche was the table / wherin the tytle was wryten / and another pyece wherein the sokette or morteys was maad that the body of the crosse stood in / soo that there were foure manere of trees / That is of palme of cypres / of cedre and of olyue / So eche of thyse foure pyeces was of one of these trees / This blessyd crosse was put in the erthe and hyd by the space of an hondred yere and more / But the moder of themperour whyche was named helayne fonde it in thys manere / For Constantyn came wyth a grete multitude of barbaryns nyghe vnto the ryuer of the dunoe / whyche wold haue goon ouer for to haue destroyed alle the contre / And whan constantyn had assembled his hoost / He wente and sette them ageynst that other partye / but assone as he began to passe the ryuer / he was moche aferde / by cause he shold on the morne haue batayle / and in the nyght as he slepte in his bedde / an aungel awoke hym / and shewed to hym the sygne of the crosse in heuen and sayd to hym / Beholde on hye on heuen / Thenne sawe he the crosse made of ryght clere lyght / & was wryten there vpon wyth lettres of golde / In this sygne thou shalte ouercome the bataylle / Thenne was he alle comforted of thys vysyon / And on the morne / he put in his banere the crosse / and made it to be borne tofore hym and his hoost / and after smote in the hoost of his enemyes / and slewe and chaced grete plente / After thys he dyd doo calle the bysshoppes of the ydolles / and demaunded them to what god the signe of the crosse apperteyned And whan they coude not answere / some crysten men that were there told to hym the mysterye of the crosse / and enformed hym in the faythe of the trynyte / Thenne anone he byleued parfytely in god / and dyd do baptyse hym and after it happed that constantyn his sone remembred the vyctorye of his fader / Sente to helayn his moder for to fynde the holy crosse / Thenne helayne wente in to Iherusalem / and dyd doo assemble alle the wyse men of the contre / and whan they were assembled / they wold fayn knowe wherfore they were called / Thenne one Iudas sayd to them / I wote wel that she wyl knowe of vs where the crosse of Ihesu cryste was leyed / but beware you al / that none of you telle hyr / For I wote wel thenne shal our lawe be destroyed / For zacheus myn olde fader sayd to symon my fader / And my fader sayd to me at his dethe / worshypped the crosse shall thenne reygne / And verayly this Ihesus was the sone of god / • adam •e wel ware / that for no tormente that ye may suffre / telle not where the crosse of Ihesu criste was leyde / For after that hit shal be founden / the Iewes shal reygne nomore / but the crysten men that Thenne demaunded I my fader / wherfore had they hanged hym on the crosse sythe it was knowen that he was the sone of god / thenne he sayd to me fayre sone I neuer accorded therto / But gayn said it al were / but the pharisees dyd it bycause he repreuyd theyr vyces / but he aroos on the thyrd day / and his dysciples seeyng he ascended in to heuen / Thenne by cause that stephen thy broder byleued in hym / the Iewes stoned hym to dethe / Thenne when Iudas had sayd thyse wordes to his felawes / they answerd we neuer herde of suche thynges / neuerthelesse kepe the wel yf the auene demaunde the therof / that thou say nothynge to hyr / whan the auene had called them / and demaunded them the place where our lord Ihesu cryste had be crucefyed / they wold neuer telle ne ensygne hyr / Thenne commaunded she to brenne them alle / but thenne they doubted and were aferde / & delyuerd Iudas to hyr and sayd / lady thys man is the sone of a prophete and of a Iuste man / and knoweth right wel the lawe / & can telle to you al thynge that ye shal demaunde hym / Thenne the quene lete al the other goo and reteyned Iudas wythout moo

crosse / ¶ Thenne sayd Iudas it is two hondred yere passed & more / & I was not thenne yet borne Thenne sayd to hym the lady / by hym that was crucyfyed / I shal make the perisshe for hungre / yf thou telle not to me the trouthe / Thenne made she hym to be caste in to a drye pytte / and there tormented hym by hungre / and euyl reste / whan he had been seuen dayes in that pytte / thenne sayd he yf I myght be drawen out / he shold say the trouthe / Thenne he was drawen out / and whan he came to the place / anone the erthe moeuyd and a fume of grete swettenesse was felte in suche wyse that Iudas smote his hondes to gyder for ioye / and sayd / in trouthe Ihesu cryste thou arte the sauyour of the world / It was so that adryan the Emperour had doo make in the same place where the crosse laye a temple of a goddesse by cause that all they that came in that place shold adoure that goddesse / But the quene dyd doo destroye the temple / Thenne Iudas made hym redy and began to dygge / and whan he came to xx paas depe / he fonde thre crosses and broughte them to the quene / And by cause he knewe not whiche was the crosse of our lord / he leyed them in the myddel of the cyte / and abode the demonstraunce of god / and aboute the houre of none / there was the corps of a yonge man brouhgte to be buryed / Iudas reteyned the byere / and layed vpon hit one of the crosses / and after the second / and whan he leyed on hit the third / anone the body that was dede came ageyn to lyf / Thenne cryed the deuyll in the eyre / Iudas what hast thou doon / thou hast doon the contrarye that thother Iudas dyd / For by hym I haue wonne many sowles / and by the I shal lose many / by hym I reygned on the peple / And by the I haue loste my royame / neuerthelesse I shal yelde to the this bountee For I shal sende one that shal punysshe the / and that was accomplysshed by Iulyan the appostata / which tormented hym afterward whan he was bysshop of Iherusalem / and whan Iudas herde hym he cursed the deuyl and sayd to hym / Ihesu cryste dampne the in fyre pardurable / After this Iudas was baptyzed and was named quyryache / And after was made bysshop of Iherusalem / ¶ Whan helayn had the crosse of Ihesu cryste / and sawe she had not the nayles / thrune she sente to the bysshop quyriache that he shold goo to the place and seke the nayles / Thenne he dyd dygge in therthe so longe / that he founde them shynyng as golde / thenne bare he them to the quene / and anone as she sawe them she worshypped them wyth grete reuererence / Thenne gafe saynt helayn a parte of the crosse to hir sone / And that other parte she lefte in Iherusalem closyd in golde / syluer and precious stones / And hyr sone bare the nayles to themperour / And the emperour dyd do sette them in his brydel and in hys helme Whan he wente to batayle / This reherceth Eusebe Whiche was bysshop of Cezayr / how be it that other say other wyse / Now it happed that Iulyan the appostata dyd doo slee quyriache that was bysshop of Iherusalem / by cause he had founde the crosse / for he hated hit soo moche / that where someuer he founde the crosse / he dyd hit to be destroyed / For whan he wente in batayle ageynst them of perse

ryuen thorugh his herte wyth a swerde / and in this manere he fynysshed his lyf / The vertue of the crosse is declared to vs by many myracles / For it happed on a tyme that one enchauntour had

more to persecute the crysten men / than doeth the sacrefise of thy goddes / The tresour of saynt cecyle is ascendyd in to heuen by the handes of poure peple / Thenne dyd he doo bete saynt vrbane wyth

Thenne flaccus seyng hym self dyspoynted and mocked / torned hym self vnto feliculam felow of saynt pernelle / and said that she shold wed hym or offre vnto thydollys / whyche bothe two she refused / thenne the prefecte sette hir in pryson and there kepte hir seuen dayes & seuen nyghtes wythout mete & drynke / and after he dyd do hange hir body on a gybet and there slewe hir / and threwe hir body

the more obstynate / To whome saynt austyn sayd / sone why payest thou not thy tythes to god and to the chyrche / knowest thou not that the tythes be not thyn but bylongen to god / And thenne the knyght sayd to hym I knowe wel that I tyle the grounde wherfore I ought as wel to haue the tenthe sheef as the ix / and whan saynt austyn coude not torne the knyghtes entente / thenne he departed from hym and wente to masse / & or he began / he charged that al they that there were acursed shold goo out of the chyrche / & thenne roos a dede body & wente out in to the chircheyerde with a whyte clothe on his heed / & stood styl there tyl the masse were doon / And thenne saynt austyn wente to hym and demaunded hym what he was / and he answerd and said I was somtyme lord of thys towne / & bycause I wold not paye my tythes to my curate / he acursed me and so I deyed and wente to helle / and thenne saynt austyn bad hym brynge hym to the place where his curate was buryed / And thenne the caryon broughte hym thyder to the graue / & by cause that al men shold knowe that lyf and deth ben in the power of god / saynt austyn said I commaūde the in the name of god to aryse / for we haue nede of the / & thēne he aroos anone and stood before al the peple / To whome saynt Austyn sayd thou knowest wel that our lorde is mercyful / and I demaunde the broder yf thou knowest this man / and he said ye / wold god that I had neuer knowen hym / for he was a wythholder of hys tythes and in al his lyf an euyl doar / thou knowest that our lord is mercyful / and as longe as the paynes of he lle endure lete vs also be mercyful to al crysten / and thenne saynt austyn delyuerd to the curate a rodde / and there the knyght knelyng on his knees was assoyled / and thenne he commaunded hym to goo ageyn to his graue / and there to abyde tyl the day of dome / and he entryd anone in to his graue and forthwyth fyl to asshys and pouldre / And thenne saynt austyn sayd to the preest how longe hast thou layen here / & he sayd an hondred & fyfty yere / and thenne he askyd how it stood with hym and he said wel holy fader for I am in euerlastyng blysse / and thenne sayd saynt austyn / wylt thou that I praye to almyghty god that thou abyde here wyth vs to conferme the hertes of men in veray beleue / and thenne he said nay holy fader / for I am in a place of reste and thenne sayd saynt Austyn goo in pees / and praye for me and for al holy chyrche / and he thenne entred ageyn in to his graue / and anone the body was torned in to erthe / •ople were conuerted and grete fame aroos in the contre / •nge fyl doun to the feet of Saynt austyn and sayd soroufully / alas woo is me that I haue •h wepyng teerys / and ••d them dyligently in the cristen ••ythe with grete ioye •on to preche the worde of god / To whome the curate sayd / holy fader the lord of thys lordshyp hath ben oftymes Of this syght the lord was sore aferde and came al quakyng to saynt austyn and to his curate and demaunded foryeuenes of his trespaas / and promysed to make amendes / and euer after to paye his tythes / and to folowe the doctryne of saynt austyn / After this saynt austyn entryd in to dorsetshyre / and came in to a towne where as were wycked peple & refused his doctryne and prechyng vtterly & droof hym out of the towne castyng on hym the tayles of thornback or like fisshes / wherfore he besought almyghty god to shewe his Iugement on them / and god sente to them a shameful token / For the chyldren that were borne after in that place had tayles as it is sayd / tyl they had repented them / It is sayd comynly that thys fyl at strode in kente / but blessyd be god at this day is no suche deformyte / Item in another place there were certeyn people whiche wold in no wyse gyue feyth to his prechyng ne hys doctryne / but scorned and mocqued hym wherfore god toke suche vengeaūce that they brennyd with fyre Inuys reed as blood & suffred so grete payne / that they were constrayned to come and axe foryeuenes of saynt austyn / and thēne he prayed god for them that they myght be acceptable to hym and receyue baptesme and that he wold relece theyr payne / and thenne he crystened them / & that brennyng hete was quenchyd / and they were made parfytely hool / and fe •ble soo that theyr skyn was ••e neuer after more therof / On a tyme as Saynt austyn was in his prayers / our lord apperyd to hym and comfortyng hym wyth a gentyl & famylyer speche sayd / O thou my good seruaunt and trewe be thou comforted and doo manly / For I thy lord god am with the in al thyn affeccion / and myn eerys ben open to thy prayers / & for whome thou demaundest ony petycion / thou shalt haue thy desyre / And the yate of euerlastyng lyf is open to the / where thou shalt ioye with me without ende / and in that same place / where our lord sayd these wordes he fyxed his staffe in to the grounde / and a welle of clere water sourded & sprange vp in that same place / the whiche welle is called cerne / and it is in the contre of dorsete / where as now is bylded a fayre abbey and is named cerne after the welle / And the chyrche is bylded in the same place where as our lord apperyd to saynt austyn / Also in the same contre was a yonge man that was lame dombe and deef and by the prayers of saynt austyn he was made hole / and thenne sone after he was dyssolute and wanton / and noyed and greuyd the peple wyth iangelyng and talkyng in the chyrche / And thenne god sente to hym his olde Infyrmyte ageyn by cause of his mysguydyng / and atte laste he fyll to repentaunce / and asked god foryeuenes and saynt austyn / and Saynt austyn prayed for hym / and he was made hole ageyn the second tyme / and after that he contynued in good and vertuous lyuyng to his lyues eyde / And after this Saynt Austyn ful of vertues departed out of thys world vnto our lord god / and lyeth buryed at caunterbu rye in the abbay that he founded there in the worshyp & rewle Where as our lord god sheweth yet dayly many myracles / and the thyrd day before the natyuyte of our lady is halowed the translacion of saynt austyn / In whiche nyght a cytezeyn of caunterburye beyng that tyme at wynchestre saw heuen open ouer the chirche of saynt austyn / and a brennyng laddre shynyg ful bryght / and aungels comyng doun to the same chyrche / And thenne hym thought that the chirche had brennyd of the grete lyght and bryghtnes that came doun on the laddre / and merua gretely what this shold mene / For he knewe no thynge of the translacion of saynt austyn / and whan he knewe the trouthe that on that tyme the body of the glorious saynt was •led translated / he yaue lawde and thankynges to almyghty god / and we may verayly knowe by that euydent vysyon that it is an holy and a deuoute place / and as it is sayd that of olde tyme auncyent holy men that vsed to come thyder / wold at the entre of it do of theyr hosen and sho on and durst not presume to goo in to that holy monasterye but barefoot / by cause so many holy sayntes ben there shryned and buryed / and god hath shewed so many myracles in that holy place for his blessyd saynt / saynt Austyn / that yf I shold al wryte them here / it shold ocupye a grete book / Thēne lete vs praye vnto saynt austyn fader & appostle of englond by whome this londe was conuerted vnto the cresten feythe / And by hys ordenaunce bysshoppes were ordeyned to mynystre the sacramentes / that he be moyen vnto our lord Ihesu cryste / that we may here so lyue accordyng to his doctryne that after this lyf we may come to euerlastyng blysse in heuen amen / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Austyn thappostle of englond Here nexte foloweth the lyf of Saynt Germayn and first the inrtepretacion of his name gErmayn is said of germe and of ana that is hye / that is that there was founden in the seed of germayn thre souerayn thynges / that is hete natu seed / Germayn is sayd seed bourgenyng / for he had in hym hete by ardour of grete dyleccion / humour by eygrenes of deuocion / and seed by vertu of his predycacion / by whyche he engendryd moche peple to the feythe / And constancien the preest wrote h ••l / humour / & noresshyng / and reson of semence or •s lyf to saynt Seueryn bysshop of Ancerre / ¶Of Saynt germayn SAynt Germayn was of moche noble lygnage born in the cyte of ancerre / & was wel lerned in the artes lyberalle / and after he wente to rome for to lerne the scyence of droyt and of the lawe / and there receyued he so moche dygnyte / that the senate sente hym to the frensshe men for to haue the rule and dygnyte of burgoyn / and thus gouerned the cyte of ancerre more dylygently than the other / there was in the myddle of the cyte a tree callyd a pynaple tree on which were hanged on y e braūches of this tree / for the mernayle of chace and huntyng / the heedes of wylde beestys that had ben sleyne / But whan saynt amadour whiche was bysshop of this cyte repreuyd them of suche vanytees / and warned them to hewe doun this tree / they wold not consente therto in ony manere / and on a tyme whan germayn was not in the cyte / the bysshop dyd do hewe doun this tree / and dyd do brenne hit / And whan Germayn knewe hit he was moche angry and forgate crysten relygyon and came with a grete multitude of knyʒtes for to haue sleyne the bysshop / •s he And thenne the bisshop knewe by reuelacion deuyne / that Saynt Germayn shold be his successour / and forbare and yaue place to his hastynes / and wente to saynt austyn / & after whan he came ageyn to ancerre / he enclosed moche subtylly germayn wythin the chyrche / and sacred hym there / and sayd to hym that he shold be his successour in the bysshop ryche / and so he was / for a lytel after saynt amadour deyed / and al the peple requyred saynt germayn to be bysshop and thenne he gaue al his rychessys to poure peple / and chaunged hys wyf in to his suster / and tormented his body by the space of thyrty yere / that he neuer ete brede of whete / ne dranke wyne / ne vsed no potage / and wold haue neuer salte to make his mete sauery / and two tymes in the yere he wold drynke wyne / that was at ester and crystemas / and yet for to take aweye the sauour of the wyne / he wold put therin plente of y e water / & in his refeccion he wold take barly breed with asshes / and fasted euery day / & neuer ete but in the euen / In wynter ne somer he had but one clothyng / & that was the hayr nexte his body / a cote & a gowne / and yf it happed so that he gaue not his vesture to somme poure body / he wold were it tyl it were broken and torne / his bedde was enuyroned wyth asshes / hayre / and sacke clothe / And his heed laye no hyer thenne hys sholdres / but al day wepte and bare aboue his necke dyuerse relyques of sayntes / he ware none other clothyng / and he wente ofte barefote / and selde ware ony gyrdle / the lyf that he ladde was aboue mannes power / hys lyf was so strayte and harde that it was merueyle and pyte to see his flesshe / and was lyke a thynge not credyble and he dyd so many myracles / that yf his merytes had not goon before they shold haue ben trowed fantasmes / In a tyme he was herberowed in a place where alwey after sowper the tables were couerd whan alle men had sowped / wherof he meruayled and demaūded the hoost wherfore they couerd the tables ageyn after sowper / and the hoost sayd it was for hys neyghbours that came to drynke eche wyth other / And that nyght saynt germayn concluded to watche for to see what hit shold be / it was not longe after that there came in there a grete multitude of deuylles and sat atte table in liknes of men and wymmen / And whan the holy man sawe them / he commaunded them that they shold not departe / and thenne sente to awake the hoost and al the neyghbours and ghestys on al sydes / in suche wyse that euery man and woman were founden in theyr howses / and he maad al them to come and see yf they knewe ony of them / and they sayd nay / and thenne he shewed them that they were deuyls / of whome the peple was moche abasshed / by cause the deuyls mocked them so / And thenne saynt germayn coniured them / and wente theyr weye / & neuer after retorned / In a tyme Saynt lowe bysshop of troyes was byseged by the kynge actylle / and saynt lowe wente vpon the yate / and demaunded who he was that assyegyd and assayled them / and the kynge said to hym I am he actylle the scorge and rodde of god / and thenne the meke bysshop sayd to hym sore wepyng / I am lowe that haue wasted the flocke of god / and haue nede of the scorgyng of god and thenne saynt lowe commaunded to opene the yates / and alle the people of actyl were so by the wylle of god blynded / that they passed thorugh the towne and sawe no men of the cyte / ne dyd no hurte to no body / And thenne the blessyd saynt lowe toke saynt germayn with hym and wente in to bretaygne where as there were heresyes / But whan they were on the see there aroos a ryght grete tempeste / whyche by the merytes of saynt germayn was anone apeased / Thenne they were honestlye receyued of the people of the contrey / whos comyng the deuyls that saynt germayn had dryuen out of suche bodyes as were bis comyng / and whan they had been a whyle in englond / and had conuaynquysshed the heretykes / they retorned in to their contrees and propre places On a tyme it happed that saynt germayn laye seek of a malady in a strete and the strete was taken wyth fyre / & men counceylled hym to be borne thens for perylle of the fyre / and thenne he put hym self ageynst the fyre / and the flawme brente al aboute / and touched no thynge that germayn laye in / Another tyme he retorned in to bretaygne for the heresyes / and one of his dysciples folowed hym hastely and fyl seek and laye doun in a towne & there deyed / and whan saynt germayn retorned therby / he demaunded to see the sepulture of his dysciple whiche there was deed / and dyd doo opene hys sepulture / & he callyd hym by his name and demaunded hym what he dyd / & yf he wold no lenger goo wyth hym and that other answerd and sayd that he was wel / and alle thynges were to hym softe and swete / & wold nomore come here / and the holy man graunted it hym that he shold abyde in reste / And he remysed hym self in his graue and slepte in our lorde / •ten / had tolde their He prechyd on a tyme in the contre of bretaygne in suche wyse that the kyng of bretayne forbad hym his hows and his peple also / Thenne it happed that the kynges cowherde wente to the pasture with his kyen / and receyued hys porcyon atte kynges paleys / and bare it to his lytyl hows / Thenne wente saynt germayn and his felawshyp for to see where they myght be lodged / And the cowherde brought hem to hys hows / and sawe that they had grete hungre / but he had not mete for them and hym / this cowherde had but one calfe / he slewe it and gaue it to them and they toke it debonayrly of the litel good that he had / and whan they had sowped and sayd graces / saynt germayn dyd do gadre to gydre alle the bones of the calfe / and layed them vnder the skyn and after made his prayers to god / & anone thenne the calfe aroos al alyue & hole as he was tofore And the next day after saint germayn demaunded the kynge why he had for bode hym his hows / and the kynge was moche abasshed & c sayd saynt germayn to hym thou shalt nomore regne / but thou shalt l and as they of saxon shold fyght ageynst the brytons / and they sawe that they were but fewe / & sawe the holy man passe by / they called hym And thenne saynt germayn and hys felowes prechyd so longe to them that they came to grace of baptesme / And on ester day they caste of theyr armures / and by grete desyre of feyth purposed them to fyght / and whan the other herde that / they purposed to goo ageynst them hardely / for they were dysseuerd / and saynt germayn hydde hym alwey wyth his peple / & warned hem whan he cryed alleluya / they shold answer wyth one voys / and whan the sayntes had cryed alleluya / and the o had answerd / theyr enemyes had so grete drede / that they threwe al theyr harneys and armoures aweye / and wende certeynly that al the mounteyns shold falle on them / and also heuen / & so they fledde all afrayed / On a tyme as saynt germayn passed by angustynence / & wente to the tombe of saynt cassyen / he enquyred how it stood wyth hym / he answerd to hym out of the tombe wherin he laye & sayd I am in swete reste / and abyde the comyng of the redemour / & he said to hym reste in pees in the name of our lord and praye for vs deuoutely / that we may deserue the holy ioyes of the resurrexyon / and whan saint germayn came in rauenne / he was receyued moche honourably of Placyde the quene / and of valentynyen hir sone / and atte sowper she sente to hym a grete vessel of syluer ful of delycyous mete / The whiche he receyued / and gaue the mete to his seruauntes / & reteyned the vessel of syluer for to gyue to the poure / And in stede of this yefte / he sente to the quene a dysshe of wood or of tree & a barly loof the whiche she receyued gladly / and after dyd doo couer that dysshe with syluer and kepte it longe in grete deuocion / •ude not answere / Thenne •ue thy royame to one better than the / ••er On a tyme that the sayd quene had desyred hym to dyne wyth hyr / he accorded therto gladly / and by cause he was wery of trauayle / of fastyng & watchyng he came vpon an asse fro his hows vnto the paleys / And anone as he was at dyner his asse deyed / And whan the quene knewe that his asse was deed she was moche sorowful / & dyd do presente hym a right fayre and good hors / and whan the saynt sawe hym so rychely aourned & apparaylled he wold in no wyse take hit / but said shewe to me where myn asse is / For he that brought me hyder shal brynge me home ageyn / and thenne he wente to his asse that laye dede and sayd to hym lete vs retorne home ageyn / and anone the asse aroos / & shoke hym as he had rysen from slepe & that he had no harme / & thenne germayn remounted on his asse and rode home / But tofore or he departed fro rauenne he said that he shold not be longe in this worlde / and anone after he became seek of the feuers / & the seuenth day after he passed vnto our lord / And his body was born in to fraunce as he had requyred to the quene / And he deyed aboute the yere of our lord four hondred & xx / Saynt Germayn had promysed by hys lyue to saynt eusebe bysshop of versayl that whan he retorned he shold halowe hys chyrche that he had founded / & whan saynt eusebe bysshop of versayl vnderstode that he was dede / he wolde hym self halowe his chyrche / and made to lyghte the candellys and tapres / but the more they lyght them / the more were they extyncte and put out / And whan eusebe sawe that / he apperceyued that the dedycacyon was made or he wold come and doo hit / or ellys of somme other bysshop / and whan the body of saynt germayn was broughte to versaylle / assone as it was entred in to the chyrche / alle the tapres were light deuynely / Thenne Saynt eusebe remembryd the promesses of saynt germayn / and that whiche he promysed lyuyng / he wold doo hit beyng deed / but it is not to be vnderstonde of the grete eusebe of versayl / that this was doon in his tyme For he deyed vnder valente themperour and fro the deth of hym vnto the dethe of saynt germayn was more than fyfty yere fro that one to that other / but thys was another eusebe xnder whome this said thynge was doon / Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Germayn Here foloweth the lyf of saynt peter thexorcisce or deken SAynt peter the deken was bounden wyth chaynes of yron in pryson o sayd Saynt peter to hym that Ihesu cryste shold wel hele hyr / yf he wolde byleue in hym / To whome archēne answerd / I meruayle moche of the / by cause thou suffrest so moche for thy god And I see that he may not delyuer the Saynt Peter sayd he wyl wel that I suffre for to deserue the glorye that alle weye shal endure / but he can wel delyuer me yf he wold and hele also thy doughter / To whome archenne sayd I shal double thy chaynes / and yf thenne thy god may delyuer the & also make my doughter hool / I shal byleue in hym / and whan that was done saynt peter cladde in whyte clothys holdyng the signe of the crosse apperyd to hym and thenne anone archenne fyl doun to his feet / and his doughter was made al hool / He thenne with al his hows receyued baptesme / and he lete out of pryson alle the crysten men

marcellyn preest / whan the prouost of Rome herde thys / he made al the crysten men come tofore hym / whom archenne gadred to gyder kyssyng theyr hondes and sayd That who wold come to be marterd shold come hardely wythout drede / And he that dare not come lete hym goo in pees where he wyl / and whan the prouoste knewe for certeyn that saynt peter and saynt marcellyn had baytysed them / he made them come tofore hym / and departed that one fro that other / and put them so in pryson And saynt marcellyn was layed naked vpon broken glasse without light or water / and saynt peter was enprysoned in a strayte place wherin he was strayned / Thenne came an aungel fro heuen and vnbonde saynt marcellyn & cladde hym and broughte hym wyth peter in to the hows of archenne / by cause they shold seuen dayes comforte the peple besyly / After whan he fonde not marcellyn in pryson where as he had sette hym / he sente for archenne / and commaunded hym and his howsholde to do sacrefyse and they wold not obeye to hym / He put thenne hym and his wyf in to a pytte in the erthe / Thenne whan saynt marcellyn and saynt peter herde telle thauenture of archenne / they came to hym & songe masse in the same pytte wyth seuen crysten men that deffendyd them / and after they sayd to the paynyms / we myght wel yf we wolde delyuer archenne and hyde our self / but we wyll doo neyther / Thenne the paynyms smote archenne wyth a swerde thorugh the body and slewe hym / and after stoned to dethe his wyf and his doughter / Thenne brought they saynt marcellyn & saynt peter to the blacke yle / and there byheded them / whiche place is called now candyda for theyr marterdom / & thus they suffred marterdō the yere of grace vij hondred foure score and seuen / and they that smote of theyr heedes sawe theyr sowles aourned wyth roses and precious stones borne vp to heuen by aungels / One dorotheus that was one of them that byheded them sawe it wherfore he became crysten / and lyued after an holy lyf / and after restyd in our lord / Thus enden the lyues of saint marcellyn and Peter Here foloweth of saint pryme and felician and of thynterpretacion first of theyr names PRimus is as moche to say as

lxxij disciples of our lord & is gretely praysed in thystorye of thactes of thappostles of many good thynges that were in hym for he was right wel enformed & ordynate / as wel to hym self as to god and to his neyghbour / he was wel ordynate in hym self after thre vertues that been in the sowle / that is to saye reson / desire & strengthe / he had reson enlumyned with the clerenes of veray knowleche / herof is said in thactes of the appostles the xiiij chappyter / it is said there that there were in the chirche of antyoche doctours prophetes & grete maisters in holy screpture / emonge whome were barnabe symon & many other grete clerkys / yet had he desyre wel ordynate & expurged fro the dust of al worldely affeccion / & therof is founde in thactes of appostles the fourth chappytre / that he solde a felde that he had / and the valewe & prys therof he layed at the feet of the appostles / & the glose sayth saynt barnabe shewed to vs heryn that we oughte leue the thynge that men shold not put theron theyr desyre ne theyr hurte / & taughte vs to despyse golde & syluer / by that that he layed the syluer atte feet of thappostles / yet had he the vertu of the sowle whiche is callyd strengthe wel affermyd wyth prowesse of pacyence / and that may we see on the grete thynges and hye / that he emprysed / and on the grete penaunces that he dyd / and on the grete tormentes & paynes that he suffred / Grete thynges thenne he enprysed / and that may we see whan he took vpon hym to conuerte soo grete a cytee as was antyoche / For whan Saynt poul came in to Iherusalem / anone after his conuersion / & wold accompanye hym with the disciples they fledde alle aweye lyke as sheep do fro wulues / But barnabe wente anone to hym and toke and brought hym in to the companye of thappostles / after he enforced his body with grete penaunces that he dyd / for he tormented hit wyth aspre and harde fastynges / yet was saynt barnabe a man enforced to suffre paynes and tormentes / For he and saynt Poule abandonned their lyues oueral for the loue of our lord Ihesu Cryste / Secondly he was ordeyned as towchyng to god in beryng auctoryte / Mageste and bounte / he bare honoure reuerence vnto the grete auctorytee of god / after that we fynde in the actes of appostles the xiij chappytre / whan the holy ghoost sayd / Take ye to me a parte barnabe and powle for to do the offyce that I haue chosen them to / yet saynt barnabe bare honoure to the grete mageste of god / For whan there shold be doon reuerence to hym and sacrefyse / as to a god / and was called Iupyter as he that wente before / and they callyd powle mercurye / as a fayr and wyse speker / anone barnabe and poule rente and tare theyr cotes / and cryed alle on hye ye peple what doo ye we ben mortal as ye be / whiche warne you to torne and conuerte to the veray god lyuyng Ihesu cryste / after saynt barnabe bare reuerence to the bounte of god after that is founden in the actes of appostles the xv chappytre / Somme conuerses of the Iewes wold mynysshe the bounte of the grace of god / and sayd that this grace that our lord had doon in his passyon suffysed not to saue vs wythout circumsycion / ageynst this errour poule & barnabe withstood vygorously and shewed to them appertely that the grace and bounte that god hath doon / is suffycient without the lawe to our sauacion / After they sente to the appostles this questyon / the which they sente anone thorugh the world epystles ageynst thys folysshe errour / after saynt barnabe was right strongly wel ordeyned ageynste hys neyghbours / For al them that were commysed in his cure / he nourisshed and fedde / in worde / in exaumple / & in bentfaytes / In word for he pronoūced to them the holy word of god and the gospel / herof is sayd in the actes of thappostles that poule and barnabe abode in antyoche prechyng the worde of god / that may be seen by the grete multitude of peple that he conuerted in the cyte of antyoche / for they conuerted so moche peple there that the dysciples lost theyr specyal name / & were callyd crysten men as the other / yet nourisshed he them that he had charge of by good ensaumple / for his lyf was to al them that sawe hym / as a myrrour of holynes / & thexemplayr of al religyon / For he was in al his werkys noble & hardy / & wel embelisshed of alle good werkys / & was ful of the holy ghoost and enlumyned & light in the feyth of our lord / al thyse foure thynges been touched of hym in thactes of thappostles / yet nourisshed he them by benefaytes in two maners / that is in almesse temporal in admynystryng to the poure their necessyte / and in other almesse spyrytuel / in foryeuyng alle rancour and euyl wylle / The fyrst almesse dyd saynt barnabe / for he bare to suche as were in right grete pouerte & myserye / that as was nedeful for them to lyue / For after that we fynde in the actes of thappostles / there was a grete famyne in the tyme of claudyus themperour / whiche famyne had agabus prophecyed / and by cause the dysciples that wold retorne to theyr brethern in to Iudee / sente vnto the moste auncien theyr almesses by the handes of barnabe and poule / the second almesse dyd saynt barnabe whan he pardoned hys angre to Ioh̄n surnamed marke / For whan the said Ioh̄n whiche was one of the dysciples was departed from the companye of barnabe and of poule / he repented hym & wold retorne to them & barnahe foryaue it hym / & toke hym ageyn to his dysciple / but poule wold not receyue hym wyth hym / Neuerthelesse that whiche was doon bytwene them bothe / was by good entencion / for in this that barnabe took hym ageyn / we may see the swetenes of his pyte / & in this that saynt poul wold not receyue hym is shewed the grete fauour of right that was in hym / after that the glose saith actuum xv / by cause this Ioh̄n had be tofore the maister of the lawe to deffende the lawe of Ih̄u cryste And had not conteyned hym vygorously for to repreue them / but had ben neglygent / For thys reason Saynt Powle wold not accorde to receyue hym in to the companye of the other / Neuerthelesse this departyng that Ioh̄n was thus departed fro the companye of saynt powle & fro the other was for no vyce that was in hym but for y e sharpenes & enspyryng of the holy ghoost to thende that they myght preche in dyuers places / after that it happed after for whā barnabe was on a tyme in the cite o

cheynes of fyre and tormenteth vs / And Iames sayde the angele of god shal vnbynd you / And goo ye to hym / and bryng hym to me bounden / but hurt hym not thenne they went and toke hermogenes and bound his hondes / and broughte hym so bounden to seynt Iames / and they said to hermogenes / thou hast sent vs thyder where we were strongly tormented and greuously bounden / And thenne sayd they to seynt Iames / gyue to vs power ayenst hym / that we may auenge the wronges and our enbracementis / And Iames sayd to them / lo here is phylete to fore you why take ye hym not / they answerd we may not touche hym / ne as moche as a flee that is in thy couche thēne sayd Iames to philete / to thende that thou doo good for euyl / lyke as cryst bad vs vnbynd hym / and thenne hermogenes was all confused / And Iames sayd to hym goo thy waye frely where thou wylt For it apperteyneth not to our discyplyne / that ony be conuerted ayenst hys wyll / And hermogenes sayd to hym / I knowe wel the yre of the deuyllis / But yf thou gyue to me som what of thyn that I may haue with me they shalle slee me / thenne seynt Iames gaf to hym his staffe / Thenne he went and brought to thappostle al his bokes / of hys fals craft and enchauntyng for to be brent / But seynt Iames by cause that the odour of y e brennyng myght do eueyl or harme to some foolis he made them to be cast in to the see / & after he had cast his bokes in to the see he retorned / and holdyng his feet said O thou delyuerer of soules receyue me penytent / and hym that hath susteyned tyl now myssayeng of the / and thenne began he to be parfyght in the drede of god our lord / so that many vertues were don by hym afterward / and whan the Iewes sawe hermogenes conuerted they were alle moeuyd of enuye / and went vnto Seynt Iames and blamed hym by cause and the passyon of our lord Ih̄u cryst in suche wyse that many byleuyd in our lord / Abyathar whyche was bysshop that yere moeued the peple ayenst hym / And thenne they put a corde aboute his necke / And brought hym to herode agrippe / and whan he was ladde for to be byheded by the commaundement of herode / A man hauyng the palsey cryed to hym / And he gaf hym helthe / And sayde in the name of Ih̄u crist for whom I am ladde to be by heded arise thou and be al hool / And blesse our lord thy maker / And anon he aroos and was alle hool / A Scrybe named Iosias whiche put the corde aboute hys necke and drewe hym seyng thys myracle / fyl doun to his feet and demaunded of hym forgyuenes / & that he myght be cristened / and whan a byathar sawe that / he made hym to be taken / and sayd to hym but yf thou curse the name of Criste thou shalt be byheded wyth hym / To whom Iosyas sayd / be thou acursed / and acursed be al thy goddes / And the name of our lord Ih̄u criste be blessyd world withouten ende / Thenne abyathar commaunded to smyte hym on the mouth with fistes / and sent a messager to herode / and gate consent that he sholde be byheded wyth Iames / And whan they shold be byheded bothe / seynt Iames desired a potte ful of water / of hym that shold smyte of theyr hedes & therwyth he baptised Iosias / & thenne anon they were bothe byheded and suffred martirdom / Seynt Iames was byheded the viij kalendes of Aprille on our lady day thanūciacion / and the viij kalendes of August he was translated to compostelle And the thred kalendes of Ianyuer he was buryed / For the makyng of hys sepulcre was fro august vnto Ianyuer and therfor the chyrche hath established that his feste shal be halowed in the viij▪ kalēdes / of august where as is most couenable tyme & as maister Ioh̄n beleth sayth whiche made this translacion dyligently / whan the blessyd seynt Iames was byheded his discyples toke the body away by nyght for fere of the Iewes / and brought it in to a shipp lord the sepulture of it / and went wyth all in to the shippe without sayle and rother And by the conduyte of thangelle of our lord they arryued in galyce in the Royame of lupa / ¶ Ther was in spaygne a quene whiche had to name and also by deseruyng of her lyf lupa whiche is as moche to saye in englyssh as a she wulf / And thenne the discyples of seynt Iames toke out his body and leyde it vpon a grete stone / And anon the stone receyued the body in to it as it had be soft waxe / and made to the body a stone as it were a sepulcre Thenne the desciples went to lupa the quene and sayd to her / our lord Ihesu cryst hath sent to the / The body of his dysciple so that hym that thou woldest not receyue alyue / thou shalt receyu and he toke them and put them in prison / and whan he was atte dyner The angelle of our lord opened the prison and lete them escape awaye alle free / And whan he knewe it he sent hastely knyghtes after for to take them as thise knyghtes passed to go ouer a bridge / the bridge brake ••nd and ouerthrewe and they fyl in the water and were drowned / And whan he herd that he repented hym and doubted for hym self and for his peple / and sent after them prayeng them for to retorne / and that he wold doo lyke as they wold them self / and thenne they retorned and conuerted the peple of that cite vnto the fayth of god / ¶ And whan lupa the quene herd this / she was moche sorouful / and whan they cam agayn to her they told to her thagrement of the kyng She anssuerd take the oxen that I haue in yonder mountaygne / and Ioyne ye and yoke them to my carte or chariote And bryng ye thenne the body of your mayster / and bylde ye for hym suche a place as ye wyl / and this she sayd to them in gyle and mockage / For she knewe wel that there were non oxen but wyld bullis / and supposed that they shold neuer Ioyne them to her charyot and yf they were so Ioyned and yoked to the chariote they wold renne hyther and thyder / and shold breke the chariot and throwe doun the body & slee them But there is no wysdom ayenst god / And thenne they that knewe nothyng the euyl corage of the quene / went vpon the mountayne and fond there a dragon castyng fyre at them / and ranne on them / and they made the signe of the crosse / and he bracke on two pieces and thenne they made the signe of the crosse vpon the bulles / and anon they were meke as lambes / Thenne they toke them and yoked them to the charyot / And toke the body of seynt Iames with the stone that they had leyde it on and leyde it in the chariot / & the wild bulles wythout gouernyng or dryuyng of ony body drewe it forth vnto the myddle of the paleys of the quene lupa / And whan she sawe thys / She was abasshyd / and byleued and was crystened / And delyuerd to them alle that they demaunded / and dedyed her paleys in to a chyrche and endowed it gretely / And after ended her lyf in good werkys / Bernard a man of the bysshopriche of mutynense as Calyxte the pope saith was taken and enchayned and put in to a depe tour / and called alway the blessyd seynt Iames / So that seynt Iames apperid to hym and sayd come and folowe me in to galyce / And thenne his bondes brake / and seynt Iames vanysshed awaye / And he went vp in to the hye tour and his bondes in his necke / and sprang doun wythout hurtyng / And it was wel lx cubytis of heyght / And as bede saith / Ther was a man that had don a foul synne / of whiche the bisshop doubted tassoyle hym / & sente hym to seynt Iames with a cedule in whiche the synne was wreton / & whan he had leyde the cedule vpon the aulter on the day of seynt Iames he prayed seynt Iames that by hys merytes hys synne myght be foryeuen and deffaced And after he opened the cedule & fond the synne effaced and striken out / Thenne he thanked god and seynt Iames / ¶ xxx men of loreyn went to gydre on pilgrimage to seynt Iames aboute the yere of our lord a M lxiij And alle made fayth to other that euery man shold abyde and serue other in alle estates that shalle happen by the waye / exepte one that wold not make none couenaunt / It happed that one of them was seek / and his fela and awayted on hym xv dayes / & atte last they deyed / and whan it was nyght / the man that was alyue was sore af for the place whiche was solytary / •rd and for the presence of the deed body / and for the cruelte of the straunge peple / and for the derknes of the nyght that cam on / But anon seynt Iames apperid to hym in lyknes of a man on hors bak and comforted hym and sayd / gyue me that dede body tofore me / and lepe thou vp behynd me on my hors / And so they roode alle that nyght xv day Iourney that they were on the morn to fore the sonne rysyng at mount Ioye whiche is but half a leeke fro seynt Iames / There seynt Iames left them both commaundyng hym that was alyue that he shold assemble the chanones of seint Iames for to burye thys pylgryme / And that he shold saye to his felawes by cause they had broken theyr fayth theyr pylgremage auayled them not And he dyd his commaundement / and whan his felawes cam they meruelled how he had so fast goon / and he told to them alle that seynt Iames had sayd and don / And as calyste the pope reherceth there was a man of al mayn and his sone went to seynt Iames about the yere of our lord Miiij score and thre / And cam to tholouse for to be lodged / and theyr host made them dronke / Thenne the host toke / a cuppe of syluer and put it in theyr male / And on the morn whan they were goon he folowed after them as theuis And bare them on hond that they had stolen / his cuppe / and sayd that they shold be punysshed yf the cuppe were founden on them / And he fond it in the male / and anon they were brought to Iugement / And thenne the sentence was gyuen / that al that they had shold be gyuen to the hoost / And that one of them shold be honged / And thenne the fader wold haue deyed for his sone / and the sone for the fader / Atte last the sone was honged / And the fader went forth wepyng on hys pylgremage to seynt Iames / And cam agayn xxxvj dayes after / And thenne went for to see his sonne and cryed and wepte / but the sone whiche was hanged began to comforte & sayd to his fader / Ryght swete fader wepe no more / For I was neuer so wel at ease for the blessyd seynt Iames hath allway susteyned and hold me vp / & hath fedde me with swetnes of heuen And whan the fader herd hym speke he ranne anon to the cyte / and dyd so moche that the peple cam / And his sone was taken doun all hool as though he neuer had / had harme / And the hoost was honged whiche had put the cuppe in to the male / Hughe de scō victore rehersith that the deuyl apperid in lykenes of seynt Iames to a pylgrym And told to hym many thynges of the vnhappynes of the world / and sayde to hym that he shold be wel blessyd yf he slewe hym self in thonour of hym / And anon he toke a knyf and slewe hym self / and thenne the hoost in whos hous he was lodged was holden suspecte / And was sore aferde to be put therfore to deth / Thēne he that was dede reuyued agayn / and sayd that the deuyl had caused to slee hym self / and brought hym in to grete tormentis / and seynt Iames ranne and brought hym to fore the trone of the Iuge / and where the deuyls accused hym / he gate that he shold be restored to his lyf / Ther was a yong man of the countray of lyons as hughe thabbot of cluyny wytnesseth that was acustomed to go ofte to seynt Iames / and the nyght tofore he shold goo thyderward he fyl in fornycacion / And the next day he went forth / On a nyght it happed that the deuyl appiered to hym in lykenes of seynt Iames / And sayd to hym / knowest thou who I am / & he answerd nay / and the deuyl sayde to hym I am Iames thappostle / whom thou hast vsed to visyte euery yere / and I am glad for thy deuocion / But it is not long syth that thou in goyng out of thy hous fyllest in fornycacōn and hast presumed to come not confessyd therof wherfor thy pylgremage may neyther plese god ne me / It apperteyneth not to doo so / For who that wyl come to me in pylgrimage / he must first shewe his synnes by con and after by goyng on pylgremage punysshe them and make satisfaccion / and thys sayd / the deuyl vanyshed awaye / Thenne this yong man was in grete anguysshe / and disposed hym to retorne home agayn to his hous and confesse hym of hys synnes / and thenne to begynne agayn his Iourney And thenne the deuyl apperid to hym agayn in lyknes of thappostle / And warnyd hym in no wyse to do so / But sayd to hym / Thys synne may in no wyse be forgyuen / ¶ But yf he cutte of his membris genytores / But yet he shold be more blessyd yf he kylled hym self / and be a martir for the name of hym / And he that same nyght whan his felawes slepte toke a knyf and cutte of his genytoyres / and wyth the same knyf smote hym self in to the bely / and his felawes awoke / and whan they sawe this thyng they were sore aferde & anon fledde awaye lest that they shold be taken as suspecte of thomycide / And after as they made redy hys pitte to burie hym in / he reuyued agayn / and thenne alle they were abasshyd and fledde awaye / And he called them agayn / and told alle that was byfallen to hym sayeng / whan I at the suggestiō of the deuyl had slayn my self / the deuyls toke me and lad me toward rome / and anon seynt Iames cam after vs / and blamed strongly the deuyllis of theyr fallace / And whan they had long stryued to gyder Seynt Iames constrayued them to com in to a medowe where the blessyd virgyne satte spekyng wyth many Seyntes And the blessid seynt Iames complayned for me / and thenne she blamed strongly the deuyllis and commaunded that I shold be restored agayn to my lyf / and thenne seynt Iames toke me and rendred to me my lyf agayn lyke as ye see / and thre dayes after his woūdes were hool & there apperid nothyng but the traces where the woūdes were and thenne he reprised agayn his Iourney / and fond his felawes / & recited to them alle thys by ordre / And as Caliste the pope reherseth there was a frenche man about the yere of our lord a M and a C wold eschewe the mortalite that was in ffraunce / and wold visite seynt Iames / and he toke his wyf and children and went thyder And whan they cam to pampelone hys wyf deyde / and his hoost toke fro hym al his moneye / and his Iument vpon whiche his chyldren were born / And this man that thus went all descomforted / and bare his chyldren on his sholdres / and ledde one after hym was in grete anguysshe and sorowe / Thenne cam a man to hym vpon an asse which had pytye on hym / and lent to hym hys asse for to bere his chyldren / And whan he cam to seynt Iames and had doon what he wold and prayed / seynt Iames apperyd to hym / and demaūded yf he knewe hym / And he sayd naye And seynt Iames sayd to hym / I am Iames thappostle / whiche haue lente to the myn asse / And yet I shal leue hym to the for to retorne / And I late the wete that thyn hoost is fallen fro a soler and is deed / and thou shalt haue agayn alle that he hath taken fro the / and whan alle thys was don he retorned Ioyous wyth his chyldren to his hows / and assone as his chyldren were taken of fro the asse / it was not knowen where it becam / •n / and to preue his prechyng fals / but thappostle ouercam hym tofore alle men resonably / And dyd many myracles tofore hym / Phylete thenne retorned to hermogenes / & approued the doctryne of Iames to be trewe and recited to hym hys myracles and sayd that he wold be his discyple And desired and counseyllyd hermogenes in lyke wyse to be his dysciple / Thenne hermogenes was wroth / And by his craft and enchauntementis he made phylete in suche wyse y• Ioyfully to seynt Iames / thenne hermogenes was angry and called many deuylles and commaūded them that they •hat he prechyd Ih̄u cryst crucifyed / And he approued clerly the comyng • / & commytted vnto the wyl of our • deed / and thēne they recited to her the myracle by ordre how they were comen wythout ony gouernayle of the shippe and requyred her place couenable for his holy sepulture / and whan the quene herd this / she sent them vnto a right cruel man by trycherye and by gyle as mayster beleth sayth / and some saye it was to the kyng of spaygne / For to haue his consent of this mater / •• abode •lle left hym sauf he that promysed not / whiche abode by hym & kept hym at the fote of the mont seint Mychel-And whan it drewe to nyght the seek man •rysion and by confession / A marchaunt was deteyned of a tyraunt / and alle despoyled was wrong fully put in pryson / And he called moche deuoutly seynt Iames in to his helpe / And seynt Iames appiered to hym to fore them that kepte hym / and they awoke / and he brought hym vnto the hyest of the tour / and anon the tour bowed doun so lowe that the toppe was euen wyth the ground / And he went out without lepyng and vnbounde of his yrons / Thenne his kepers folowed after but they had no power to see hym / Thre knyghtes of the dyocyse of lyon went to seynt Iames / and that one was requyred of a pour woman / whiche for the loue of seynt Iames to bere her sacke vpon his hors / and he bare it after he fond a man seke / and sette hym on hys hors / and toke the burdon of the man and the sacke of the sayd woman and folowed his hors a fote / but he was broken with the hete of the sonne and wyth labour to goo a foote / that whan he cam to seynt Iames in galyce / he was strongly seke / And his felawes prayed iij dayes for the helthe of his soule / whiche iij dayes he lay specheles / and his felawes abydyng hys deth the fourth day / he syghed gretly and sayd / I thank god & seynt Iames for I am delyuerd by hys merites / Whan I Wolde haue don that Whiche ye Warned and admonested me / But the deuyls cam to me and strayned me so sore that I myght doo no thyng that apperteyned to the helthe of my soule / and I herd you wel but I myght not answere / And thēne the blessid seynt Iames cam & brought in his lyfte hond the sacke of the Woman / and in the ryght hond the burdon of the pour pylgrym that I helped by the Waye / and held the burdon for a spere / And the sacke for a shylde and so assayled the deuyls as alle angry / and lyft vp the burdon & fered the deuyllis that they fledde awaye / & thus the blessyd saynt Iames hath delyuerd me by his holy grace / And hath rendred to me my speche agayn Calle me the preest for I may not be long in this lyf / It is tyme to amende our trespaces toward our lord / And thenne he torned hym to one of hys felawis / and sayd to hym / Frend ride no more With thi lord for certeynly he is dampned / and shalle perisshe shortly by euyl deth / And therfor leue his companye / and thenne he deyed / And Whan he Was buryed his ij felawes knyghtes retorned / and that other said to his mayster this that he had said to hym / and he sette not therby / And had despyte to amende hym / And anon after he was smyton with a spere in batayle and deyed / And as calyste the pope sayth / that there was a man of vir And his money fayled hym by the Waye / And he had shame for to begge and aske almesse / and he leyed hym to rest vnder a tree / and dremed that Seynt Iames fedde hym / And whan he a woke he fond a loof baken vnder asshen at his hede / And With that loof he lyued xv dayes tyl that he cam agayn to his owen place / and ete suffysauntly twyes a day of the same loof / And alwaye on the morn he fond it hool in his sachet / Also the same Caliste reherseth that a bourgeys of the cyte of barselone went to Seynt Iames about the yere of our lord MiC / and requyred only that he shold neuer be taken of ony enemyes / and as he retorned by Sysyle he was taken in the see of sarasyns / and ledde oft tymes to fayres for to be sold / but alway the chaynes with whiche he was bounden losed / and whan he had be sold xiiij tymes he was bounden wyth double cheynes / Thenne he called seynt Iames to his helpe / and seynt Iames apperyd to hym and sayd by cause thou were in my chyrche / and thou settest nothyng by the helth of thy soule / But demaundest only the delyueraunce of thy body / therfor thou hast fallen in thys peryl / but bycause that our lord is merciful / he hath sente me for to bye the / and anon his chaynes brake / & he beryng a parte of the chaynes passed by the contrays & castellys of the sarasyns and cam home vnto hys owen countraye in the sight of all men whiche were abasshed of the myracle / For whan ony man Wold haue taken hym / as sone as they sawe the cheyne they were aferd and fledde / And whan the lyons and other bestes wold haue ronne on hym in the desertes where as he went / whan they sawe the cheyne they were afferd that they fledde away It happed that in the yere MCCxxx & viij In a castel named praat bytwene Florence and pyscoye / A yong man deceyued of symplesse by counseyle of an olde man sette fyre in the corn of his tutour / whiche had charge to kepe hym / by cause that he wold vsurpe to hym self hys herytage / Thenne he was taken and confessyd his trespas and was Iuged to be drawen and brent / thenne he confessyd hym and avowed to seynt Iames / And whan he had be long drawen in his sherte vpon a stony waye / he was neyther hurt in his body ne in his sherte / Thenne he was bounden to a stake / and fagottis and busshes were sette aboute hym and fyre put therto / whiche fyre brent a two his bondes / And he alway called on seynt Iames / and there was no hurte of brennyng founden in his sherte nor in his body / and whan they wold haue cast hym agayn in to the fyre / he was taken away fro them by seynt Iames thappostle of god / to whom be gyuen laude and praysyng / •liac Went to seint Iames / Here foloweth of seynt Cristophre / and first of his name CHristofre to fore his baptesme was named reprobus / But afterward he was named xpōfer which is as moche to saye as beryng cryste / of that / that he bare cryst in iiij maners / he bare hym on his sholdres by conueyeng and ledyng / In his body / by makyng it lene / In mynde by deuocion / And in his mouth by confessyon and predycacion / ¶Of Seynt Christofre CHristofre was of the lygnage of the Canances / And he was of a right grete stature And had a terryble & ferdful chore and countenaunce / And he was xij cubytes of lengthe / And as it is redde in somme histories / that whan he serued & dwelled with the kyng of cananees it cam in his mynde that he wold seche the grettest prynce that was in the World / & hym wold he serue and obeye / And so ferre he went y t he cam to a right grete kyng of whom the renomme generally was that he was the grettest of the world / and when the kyng sawe hym he receyued hym in to his seruyse / and made hym to dwelle in his courte / Vpon a tyme a mynystral song to fore hym a song / in whiche he named ofte the deuyll / And the kyng which was a crysten man whan he herd hym name the deuyll / made anon the signe of the crosse in his vysage / and whan xpōfer sawe that he had grete merueyle what signe it was / and wherfor the kyng made it / And he demaunded of hym And bycause the kyng wold not saye he sayd / yf thou telle me not I shalle no lenger dwelle wyth the / and thenne the kyng told to hym sayeng / alleway whan I here the deuyl named / I fere that he shold haue power ouer me / and I garnysshe me wyth this signe / that he greue ne anoye me / thenne xpōfer sayde to hym doubtest thou the deuyll / that he hurte the not / thenne is the deuyl more myghty & gretter than thou art / I am thenne deceyued of my hope and purpose / ffor I had supposed I had founden the most myghty & the moste grettest lord of y e world / but I cōmaūde the to god / for I wyl goo seche hym for to be my lord and I his seruaunt / and thenne departed fro this kyng / And hasted hym for to seche the deuyl / and as he went by a grete deserte / he sawe a grete companye of knyghtes of which a knyght cruel & horrible cam to hym & demaunded whider he went & xpōfor ansuerd to hym & sayd / I goo seche the deuyl for to be my mayster / & he sayd I am he that thou sechest / & thēne xpōfer was glad & bond hym self to be hys seruaunt perpetuel and toke hym for his mayster & lord / and as they went to gydre by a comyn waye / they fonde there a crosse erecte & stondyng / & anon as the deuyll sawe the crosse he was aferd and fledde and left the right waye / and brought xpōfer aboute by a sharpe deserte / and after whan they were passyd the crosse he brought hym to the hye way that they had lefte / and whan xpōfer sawe that he merueylled and demaunded wherof he doubted & had left the hye and feyr way / & had goon so ferre about by so aspre deserte And the deuyl wold not telle to hym in no wise / Thenne cristofer said to hym yf thou wylt not telle me / I shal anon departe fro the and shall serue the no more / wherfor the deuyl was constrayned to telle hym and sayd / there was a man called cryst whiche was hanged on the crosse / and whan I see his signe I am sore aferd and sle fro hit where someuer I see it / To whom xpōfer said thēne he is gretter and more myghtier than thou / whan thou art aferd of his signe / and I see wel that I haue laboured in vayn / whan I haue not foūden the gretest lord of the world / And I wil serue the no lenger / goo thy waye thenne for I wyl goo seche Ih̄u Criste And whan he had long sought and demaunded where he shold fynd crist Atte last he cam in to a grete deserte to an hermyte that dwellyd there / and this hermyte preched to hym of Ihesu crist and enformed hym in the fayth dylygently and sayd to hym / Thys kyng whom thou desirest to serue / requyreth the seruyse that thou must oft faste / And xpōfer sayd to hym requyre of me somme other thyng and I shall doo it for that whiche thou requyrest I may not doo / And the hermyte sayd / thou must thenne wake and make many prayers / And cristofer said to hym I wote not what it is / I may doo no suche thyng / and thenne the hermyte sayd to hym knowest thou suche a ryuer in whiche many be perysshed and lost / to whom cristofer seyd / I knowe it wel / thenne said the heremyte by cause thou art noble and hye of stature / and strong in thy membris thou shalt be resident by that ryuer / and thou shalt bere ouer al them that shall passe there which shal be a thyng ryght couenable to our lord Ih̄u crist / whom y u desirest to serue / & I hope he shal shewe hym self to the / thēne sayd cristofer certes this seruyse may I wel do & I promyse to hym for to doo it / thenne Went cristofer to this ryuer / & made there his habitacle for hym & for a grete pool in his hand in stede of a staf by Which he susteyned hym in the Water / And bare ouer al maner of peple wythout cessyng / and there he obode thus doyng many dayes And in a tyme as he slepte in his lodge he herd the voys of a chylde whiche called hym and sayd / xpōfer come out / and bere me ouer / Thenne he awoke and Went out / but he fond no man / And whan he was agayn in his hous / he herd the same voys and he ran out and fond no body / The thyrd tyme he was called and cam theder and fond a chylde besyde the ryuage of the ryuer / Whiche prayed hym goodly to bere hym ouer the Water / And thenne xpōfer lyft vp the chylde on his sholdres and toke hys staffe and entred in to the Ryuer for to passe / And the water of the ryuer aroos and swellyd more and more / And the chyld was heuy as leed / And alway as he went ferther / the water encresed and grewe more / And the chyld more and more wexyd heuy in so moche that xpōfre had grete anguysse / and was aferd / to be drowned And whan he was escaped with grete payne and passyd the water / And sette the chyld a grounde / he sayd to the chyld / Chylde thou hast put me in grete peryl / thou Wayest alle most as I had had alle the world vpon me I myght bere no greter burdon / And the childe answerd / Crystofre merueyle the nothyng / For thou hast not only born alle the world vpon the / But thou hast born hym that created & made alle the world vpon thy sholdres / I am Ih̄u cryste the kyng / to Whom thou seruest in thys werke / And bycause that thou knowe that I saye to the trouthe / sette thy staf in the erthe by thy hous / and thou shalt see to morne that it shalle bere floures and fruyte and anon he vanysshed from his eyen And thenne cristofre sette his staf in therthe / and whan he aroos on the morn he fond his staf lyke a palmyer beryng floures leues and dates / and thenne Cristofre went in to the cite of lycye / and vnderstode not theyr langage / Thenne he prayed our lord that he myght vnderstonde them / and so he dyd And as he was in this prayer / The Iuges supposed that he had be a fool / And left hym there / And thenne whan cristofre vnderstode the langage / He couerd his visage and went to y • place Where they marterd crysten men / and comforted them in our lord / and thēne the Iuges smote hym in the face / and xpōfer sayd to them / If I were not crysten I shold anon auenge myn Iniurye / And thenne Cristofre pyiched his rodde in therthe / And prayed to our lord that for to conuerte the people it myght bere floures and fruyt / and anon it dyd soo / And thenne he conuerted viij thousand men / and thenne the kyng sent two knyghtes for to fetche hym to the kyng / and they fond hym prayeng / And durst not telle to hym soo / And anon after the kyng sent as many mo / And they anon sette them doun for to praye wyth hym And whan xpōfre aroos he sayde to them What seche ye / And whan they sawe hym in the vysage / they sayde to hym / the kyng hath sent vs that we shold lede the bounden vnto hym / And Cristofre sayd to them / yf I wold ye shold not lede me to hym boūden ne vnbounden / And they sayd to hym yf thou wylt goo thy waye / goo quyt where thou wylt / And we shalle say to he kyng / that we haue not founde the / hit shall not be so / sayde he / But I shalle goo with you / and thenne he conuerted them in the fayth / And commaunded them that they shold bynde his hōdes behynd his backe / and lede hym so bounden to the kyng / and whan the kyng sawe hym he was aferd and fil doun of the siege and his seruauntes lyft hym vp and releuyd hym agayn / And thenne the kyng enquyred his name and his contray / & cristofre said to hym / tofore or I was baptised I was named reprobus & after I am named xpōfer / tofore baptem a cananee / now a cristen man / to whom the kyng said / thou hast a folissh name that is to wete of crist crucifyed whiche conde not helpe hym self ne may not proffite to the / How therfor thou cursid cananyen why wylt thou not do sacrefyse to our goddes / to whom cristofre sayd / y u art righfully called dagarus for thou art the deth of the world / and felaw of the deuyl / & thy goddes ben made wyth the hondes of men / And the kyng sayde to hym thou were norysshed emong wyld bestes / & therfor thou mayst not say but wyld langage and wordes vnknowen to men / And yf thou wylt now doo sacrefyse to the goddes / I shalle yeue to the grete yeftes and grete honours / and yf not I shalle destroye the and consume by grete paynes and tormentis / But for alle thys he wold in no wyse do sacrefyse / wherfor he was sent in to pryson / And the kyng dyd do behede the other knyghtes that he had sent for hym whom he had conuerted / and after thys he sent in to the pryson to Seynt Christofer two fayre wymen of whom that one was named vysena / And that other Aquylyne / and promysed to them many grete yeftes yf they coude drawe xpōfer to synne with them / And whan xpōfer sawe that he sette hym doun in prayer / And whan he was constrayned by them that enbraced hym to meue / he a and sayde what seke ye / For what cause be ye comen hyther / And they whiche were affrayed of his chyere and clerenes of his vysage sayden / holy seynt of god haue pite of vs so that we may byleue in that god that thou prechest / And whan the kyng herde that / He commaunded that they shold be laten out and brought to fore hym / to whom he sayde / ye be deceyued / but I swere to you by my goddes / that yf ye doo no sacrefise to my goddes ye shal anon peryssh by euyl deth / And they sayde to hym yf thou wylt that we shalle do sacrefyse / commaunde that the places may be made clene / and that alle the peple may assemble at the temple / and whan this was doon they entred in to the temple and toke theyr gyrdles and put them aboute the neckes of theyr goddes / And drewe them to therthe / and brake them alle in peaces and sayd to them that were there / Goo and calle phisiciens and leches for to hele your goddes / And thenne by the commaundement of the kyng / Aquylyne was honged / and a ryght grete and heuy stone was honged at her feet / so that her membres were moche despitously broken / And whan she was dede and passyd to our lord / her suster vicena was cast in to a grete fyre / but she yssued out without harme alle hool / and thenne he made to smyte of her hede / And so suffred deth / After this xpōfer was brought tofore the kyng / And the kyng commaunded that he shold be beten with roddes of yron / and that there sholde be sette vpon his hode a crosse of yron rede hote and brennyng and thenne after he dyd do make a siege or a stole of yron / and made christofer to be bounden theron / And after to sette fyre vnder it / And caste theryn pytche / but the siege or setyl malte like waxe / And Christofer yssued out wythout ony harme or hurte / And whan the kyng sawe that / He commaunded that he shold be bunde to a strong stake and that he shold be thrugh shoten wyth arowes wyth xl knyghtes archers / •oos But none of the knyghtes myght attayne hym / For the arowes henge in thayer about nyghe hym wythout touchyng / Thenne the kyng wende that he had be thrugh shoten wyth the arowes of the knyghtes / and adressid hym for to goo to hym / And one of the arowes retorned sodenly fro the ayer / And smote hym in the eye and blynded hym / To whom Chrystofer sayde / Tyraunt I shalle dye to morn make a lytyl claye wyth my blood temperyd and enoynte therwyth thyn eye / and thou shalt receyue helthe / Thenne by the commaundement of the kyng he was ladde for to be byheded & thenne there he made hys oryson / & hys hede was smeton of and so suffred martirdom / And the kyng thenne toke a lytyl of his blood and leyde it on hys eye / and sayde in the name of god and of Seynt xpōfer / and was anon heled / Thenne the kyng by leued in god and gaf commaūdement that yf ony persone blamed god or seynt xpōfer / he shold anon be sleyne with the swerd / Ambrose sayth in his preface thus of this holy martir / lord thou hast gyuen to xpōfer so grete plente of vertues / & suche grace of doctryne that he called fro the errour of paynems xlviij thousand men to thonour of cristen fayth by hys shynyng myracles / And vesene and aquylene whiche long had ben comyne atte bourdel vnder the stenche of lecherye / He callyd and made them serue in thabyte of chastyte / And enseygned them to a lyke crowne of martirdom / And wyth thys he beyng strayned and bounden in a fete of yron and grete fyre put vnder doubted nothyng the hete / And alle an hole day duryng stode bounden to a stake / Myght not be thrugh persed with arowes of alle the knyghtes / And wyth that / one of the arowes smote out the eye of the tyraunte / To whom the blode of the holy martir restablysshed hys syght / and enlumyned hym in takyng awaye the blyndnes of hys body / and gate of the crysten mynde and pardon And also gate of the by prayer to put away sekenes and sores fro them that remembre hys passyon and fygure / Thenne late vs praye to seynt xpōfre that he praye for vs & c̄ / Thus endeth the lyf of seynt Christofre martyr / ¶ Of the seuen Slepars THe seuen slepars were born in the cite of Ephesym / And whan decyan themperour cam in to Ephesym for the persecucion of cristē men he commaunded to edefye the temples in the myddle of the cyte / so that alle shold come wyth hym to doo sacrefyse to thydollys / And dyd do seche al the crysten peple and bynde them for to make them to do sacrefyse or ellys to put them to deth / In suche wyse that euery man was aferde of the raynes that he promysed / that the frende forsoke hys frende / And the sone renyed hys fader / And the fader the sone / And thenne in thys cite were founden seuen crysten men that is to wete / maxymyen / Malchus / marcyanus / deny and Constantyn And whan they sawe thys they had moche sorowe / and by cause they were the first in the paleys that despysed the sacrefises / they hyd them in theyr howses / and were in fastynges and in prayers / And thenne they were accused to fore dacien and cam thyder and were founden very crysten men / thenne was gyuen to them space for to repente them / vnto the comyng agayn of dacyen / And in the mene whyle they despended thayr patrymonye in almesse to the poure peple / • Ioh̄n / Serapyon / And assembled them to gydre & toke counseyl and went to the mount of Celyon / And there ordeyned to be more secretly / And there hyd them long tyme / And one of them admynystred and serued them alle waye / And whan he wente in to the cyte / he clothed hym in thabyte of a beggar / whan dacyen was comen agayn he commaūded that they shold be fette / And thenne malchus whyche was theyr seruaunte and mynystred to them mete & drynke retorned in grete drede to hys felawes and told and shewed to them the grete f and wodenes of themperour / And thenne were they sore aferde And malchus sette tofore them the loues of breed that he had brought so that they were comforted of the mete And were more strong for to suffre tormentis / and whan they had taken theyr refection and satte in wepyng and waylynges sodenly as god wold they slepte / And whan it cam on the morne they were sought and coude not be founden / Wherfor Dacien was sorouful by cause he had lost suche yong men / And thenne they were accused that they were hydde in the mount of Celyon / And had gyuen theyr goodes to poure men and yet abode in theyr purpoos / And thenne commaunded decius that theyr kynrede shold come to hym and menaced them to the deth yf they sayde not of them alle that they knewe / And they accused them and comployned that they had despended al theyr richesses / thenne decius thought what he shold doo wyth them / and as our lord wold he enclosed the mouth of the caue wherin they were wyth stones to thende that they shold dye therin for hungre and faute of mete / thenne the mynystres / and two crysten men / Theodore and Ruffyne wrote their martirdom and leyde it subtilly emong the stones / And whan decius was deed and alle that generacion thre Clxxij yere after / and the xxx yere of Theodocien the emperour whan the heresye was of them that denyed the Resurrexyon of deed bodyes and began to growe / Theodocien thenne the most cristen emperour beyng sorouful that the faith of our lord was so felonysly demened for angre and heuynes he cladde hym in hayre and wepte euery day in a secrete place / and ladde a ful holy lyf / whiche god merciful and piteous seeyng wold conforte them that were sorouful and wepyng / and gyue to them esperaunce and hope of the resurexyon of deed men / And opened the precyous tresour of his pyte and reysed the forsayde martirs / in thys maner folowyng / he put in the wylle of a burgeys of ephesym / that he wold make in that montayn whiche was deserte and aspre a stable for his pastours & herdemen / And it happed that of aduenture the masons that made the sayd stable opened thys caue / ¶ And thēne thyse holy seyntes that were with in awoke and were reysed / and entre salewed eche other / And had supposed veryly that they had slepte but one nyght only / And remembred of the heuynes that they had the day tofore / And thenne malcus whiche mynystred to them sayd what decyus had ordeyned of them for he sayd we haue ben sought lyke as I sayd to you yesterday for to doo sacrefyse to thydollys / that is that themperour desireth of vs / and thenne maxymyen ansuerde / god our lord knoweth that we shalle neuer sacrefye / And comforted his felawes / He commaunded to malchus to goo & by breed in the cyte / And bad hym bryng more than he dyd yesterday / and also tenquyre and demaunde what themperour had commaunded to doo / And thenne malcus toke v shilynges And yssued out of the caue / and whan he sawe the masons & the stones tofore the caue / he began to blysse hym / and was moche admerueyllyd / But he thought litil on y e stones / for he thought on other thyng / Thenne cam he alle doubtous to the yates of the cite / And was al admerueylled / For he sawe the signe of the crosse about the yate / and thēne without taryeng he went to that other yate of the cyte and fond there also the signe of the crosse theron / and thenne he had grete merueyle / ffor vpon euery yate he sawe sette vp the signe of the crosse / And therwith the cite was garnysshed / And thenne he blessyd hym and retorned to the first gate / & wende he had dremed / and after he aduysed and comforted hym self / and couered his vysage and entred in to the cite / and whan he cam to the sellars of brede And herde the men speke of god yet thenne was he more abasshyd / and said What is this that no man yesterday durst name Ihesu cryste / And now euery man confessyth hym to be cristen I trowe thys is not the cite of ephesym For it is alle otherwyse buylded / It is somme other cite I wote not what / And whan he demaunded and herde veryly that it was ephesym / he supposed that he had er / •yd And thought veryly to goo agayn to hys se And whan he shewed his money the sellers merueyled / and sayde that one to that other / that thys yong man had soūden somme olde tresour / and whan malchus sawe them talke to gydre / he doubted that they wold lede hym to the emperour / and was sore aferde / and prayed them to and breed / but they helde hym / and sayd to hym / Of wh and we shalle be felaws with the and kepe it secrete / And mal aferd that he wyst not what to saye to them for drede / And whan they sawe that he spacke not / They put a corde aboute hys necke / and drewe hym through the cyte vnto the myddle And tydynges were had al aboute in the cyte that a yong man had foūd auncyent tresour in suche wyse that alle they of the cyte assembled aboute hym / And confessyd there that he had founden no tresoure And he byheld them alle / but he coude knowe no man there of his kynrede ne bygnage whiche he had verily supposed that they had lyued / but he fond non wherfor he stode as he had ben from hym self in the myddle of the cyte / And whan seynt martyn the bisshop and an typater the consul whiche were newe comen in to this cite / herd of this thyng they sent for hym that they shold bryng hym wysely to them & his money with hym / And whan he was brought to the chirche he wende wel he shold haue ben ledde to themperour decius / And thenne the bisshop and the consul merueylled of the money / and they demaūded hym where he had founden this tresour vnknowen / ¶ And he answerd that he had nothyng founden / But it was comen to hym of his kynrede and patrymony / and they demaunded of hym of what cite he was / I wot wel that I am of thys cite / yf this be the cyt And the Iuge sayd to hym / Late thy kynrede come and wytnesse for the / And he named them But none knewe them / And they sayd that he fayned for tescape fro them in some maner / And thenne sayd the Iuge how may we byleue the that this money is comen to the / of thy frendes whan it appereth in the scripture that it is more than iijClxxij yere sithe it was made and forged / and is of the first dayes of decyus themperour / And it resembleth nothyng to our money / & how may it come fro thy lygnage so long sythe / and thou art yong / and woldest deceyue the wyse and auncient men of thys cyte of Ephesym / And therfor I commaund that thou be demened after the lawe / til thou hast confessyd where thou hast founde this money Thenne malchus kneled doun tofore them and sayd / For goddes sake lordes say ye to me that I shal demaunde you And I shal telle to you al that I haue in my herte / Decius themperour that was in thys cite where is he / And the bysshop sayde to hym / sone there is no suche at thys day in the world that is named decyus / he was emperour many yeres sithe / And malchus sayd syre herof I am gretely abasshyd / and noman byleueth me / For I wote wel that we fledde for fere of decyus themperour / & I sawe hym that yesterday he entred in to thys cite / yf this be the cite of ephesym thēne the bisshop thought in hym self / & sayde to the Iuge that this is a vision that our lord wyl haue shewd by thys yong man / Thenne said the yong man folowe ye me / & I shal shewe to you my felawes whiche ben in the mount of Celion / And byleue ye them / ¶ Thys knowe I wel that we fledde fro the face of themperour decyus / And thenne they went wyth hym and a grete multitude of the peple of the cyte wyth them / And malchus entred first in to the caue to his felawes / And the bysshop next after hym And there fond they emong the stones the letters sealed wyth two sealis of siluer / And thenne the byssh called them that were comen thyder / and redde them tofore them alle / ¶ So that they that herd it were all abasshyd and admerueyllyd / ¶ And they sawe the Seyntes sittyng in the caue / And theyr vysages like vnto roses flouring and they knelyng doun glorifyed god And anon the bysshop and the Iuge sent to theodocyen themperour / prayeng hym that he wold come anon for to s lord that he had late shewed / And anon he aroos vp fro the grounde / And toke of the sacke in whiche he wepte / And glorifyed our lord / And cam fro constantinople to Ephesym / And alle they cam ayenst hym / And ascendyd in to the mountayne wyth hym to gydre vnto the saintes in to the caue •rour • •awes / And thēne went to them that sold brede •a•e hym goo / and kepe both money •ns art thou / For thou hast founden tresours of olde emperours / Shewe it to vs ••us was so • of Ephesym / •p •e the merueylles of our And assone as the blessyd seyntes of our lord sawe themperour come / theyr visages shone lyke to the sonne / And themperour entrid thenne and glorified our lord and enbraced them wepyng vpon eche of them and sayde / I see you now lyke as I shold see our lord reysyng lazare / And thenne maxymyen sayd to hym / byleue vs / For for sothe our lord hath reysed vs tofore the day of the grete resurrection / And to thende that thou byleue fermly the resurection of the dede people / Meryly we ben raysed as ye here see and lyue And in lyke wyse as the chyld is in the wombe of hys moder without felyng harme or hurte / In the same wise we haue be lyuyng and slepyng in lyggyng here without felyng of ony thyng / And whan they had sayde alle thys / they enclyned theyr hedes to therthe / and rendrid their spirites at the commaundement of our lord Ih̄u Criste / and so deyed / Thenne themperour aroos and fyl on theym wepyng strongly / and enbraced them / And kyssed them deboneyrlye And thenne he commaunded to make precious sepulcres of gold and siluer and to burye theyr bodyes therin / and in the same nyght they appiered to the Emperour / and sayde to hym / that he shold suffre them to lye on therthe lyke as they had leyn to fore til that tyme that our lord had reysed hem / vnto the tyme that they shold rise agayn / Thenne commaunded themperour that the place shold be aourned nobly and richely with precyous stones / and all the bysshops that Wold confesse the resurrection shold be assoyled / It is doubte of that whiche is sayde that they slepte CCClxij yere / For they were reysed the yere of our lord iiijClxxviij / and decius regned but one yere and thre monethes / and that was in the yere of our lord ijC & lxx And so they slepte but ijC & viij yere Thus endeth the historye of the seuen slepars Here foloweth the lyf of seynt Nazarien and first of the Interpretacion of his name / NAzarien is said of Nazareus that is as moche to say as consecrate / or clene / Or departed / or ffloured / or kepyng / In a man ben founden thyse fyue / Cogytacion / Affection / Intencion / Action / and locucion / or speche / Cogytacion or thought ought to be holy / Affection clene / Intencion ryght / Action Iuste And locusion or speche moderate / Alle thys thynges were in seynt Nazaryen he had an holy cogitacion or thought / And therof he is sayde consecrate / He had affection clene / And therof he is sayd clene / he had intencion right / & therof he is sayd departed / Intencion is that departeth werkes for of a symple eye cometh a bright body / Of a shrewd eye is made a derke body / He had Accōn Iuste / and therof he is sayd floured / For a Iuste man shalle floure lyke a lylye / Spekyng or locucion moderate / and therof he is sayd kepyng / for he hath kepte his wayes in suche wyse that he hath not trespaced in hys tongue / Celsus is as moche to saye as hye / For he enhaunsed hym aboue hym self / whan he ouercam hys chyldysshe age by the vertu of his corage / hit is sayd that ambrose in the boke of geruase and prothase hath rehersed the lyf and passyon of them / In somme bokes it is redde / That there was a phylosophre hauyng deuocion to nazaryen that wrote his passyō whiche ceracius whiche buryed the bodyes of the seyntes leyde it at the hede of them / Of seint nazarien & seint celse NAzarien was sone of a noble man named Affrican but he was a Iewe and of seynt perpetua most cristen woman and comen of the noblest of the romayns / and had be baptised of seynt peter thappostle / whan he was ix yere olde / he merueilled gretely seyng his fader and moder so gretely to varye in thobseruacion of theyre religyon for his moder kepte the lawe of bapteme / and his fader folowed the lawe of y e sabate wherfor to whō he myghte folow of them he doubted moche / for they bothe laboured to drawe hym to theyr fayth / atte last by the wil of god he folowed the lawe of his moder / and receyued y e holy bapteme of seynt lyne the pope / whiche whan the fader knewe he began to exorte & drawe hym fro his holy purpos / And rehersed to hym by ordre alle the maner of tormentis that Were ordeyned for crysten men but he myght not withdrawe hym fro his holy purpose / That Whiche is sayde that he was baptised of lyne the pope / it is to vnderstond that lyne was not thēne pope / but afterward he Was pope / Nazaryen lyued after his bapteme many yeres as it shal appere here after / whiche saffred martirdom vnder Nero / Whiche crucyfyed peter the last yere of his regne / Thenne whan Nazaryen wold in no Wyse assent to his fader but prechyd crist most constantly / His kynrede dradde lest he shold be slayne and at theyr request and prayer he departed out of rome / And toke wyth hym vij somers charged & laden wyth riches and goodes / whiche alle he gaf to pour peple in the partyes of Italye to Whiche he cam / And the tenth yere that he departed fro rome he cam to placense and fro thens to mylane / And fond there geruase and prothase holden in pryson whom he comforted / & Whan it was knowen that Nazarien had comforted / and encoraged the sayde marters / He was anon taken & brought to the prefecte / and he alway abydyng stydfastly in the fayth & knoulechyng of cryst / was beten with staues / And so cast out of the cite / and as he Went fro place to place / his moder Whyche thenne was deed apperyd to hym / & comforted hym / and warned hym that he shold goo in to ffraunce / and so he dyde / And whan he cam in to a toun of fraunce which that hyght gemellus and had conuerted moche peple to the fayth of Ih̄u cryst / There was a noble woman whiche offred to hym her sone named cesse / whiche was an elegante and fayre childe / prayeng hym that he wold baptyse hym and take hym with hym / and whan the prefecte of fraunce herd herof / he toke hym and the chylde celse with theyr hondes boūden behynd them / and a chayne in theyr neckes put them in prison / for to torment them on the morne / Thenne the wyf of the prefecte sent to hym affermyng that it was not rightfully doon y t he shold sle Innocentes / but the goddes almyghty shold presume to auenge them / By whiche wordes the prefecte was corrected / & deliuerd the Innocentis but charged & warned them y t they shold no more preche there thenne he icam to the cite of tryre & he was the frst that prechyd crist & conuerted many to y e fayth & there edefyed a chyrche / & whan cornelye lyeutenant of nero herd herof he sent thyder an hondred knyghtes for to take hym / and they fonde hym in an Oratorye that he had made / And toke hym and bound hys hondes sayeng / the grete nero hath sent for the / to whom nazaryen sayd / the kyng al out of ordre hath also knyghtes out of ordre / why cam ye not honestly and sayd / New calleth the / and I wold haue comen / Thenne they ledde hym bounden so to New / and Celse the chyld wepyng they smote and buffetted hym / And constrayned hym to folowe / and whan New sawe them he commaunded to put them in pryson tyl they there deyed by tormentis / And on a day whan New sent his hunters to take wyld festys / Sodenly a grete multitude of wylde beestes / brake theyr ordenaunce / and entryd the gardyn of nero where they slowe and al to rente many men / that nero alle troubled fledde / and hurted his foot / that vnnethe he myght come to his paleys / and after laye many a day / and myght not remeue for the payne of the wound / Atte last he remembryd of nazaryen and celse / and supposed his goddes were wroth wyth hym / bycause he suffred them to lyue so long / Thenne by the commaundement of themperour / knyghtes bete them both and brought them to fore themperour Nero sawe theyr vysages shyne lyke the sonne / And he supposed that they had don it fantastykly to moche hym by magyk / and commaunded them to put away theyr enchauntementis / and offre to the goddes / Thenne was nazaryen ledde to the temple and prayed that alle men shold goo out / And thenne he made hys prayers to god / And alle thydolles fyl doun and were broken / and whan new herd that he commaunded to cast hym in to the see And yf it happed that he escaped they shold folowe and take hym and brenne hym / & shold take the ashes of hym & cast it in to the see nazaryen thene & the chyld Celse were put in a shyppe / and brought in to the myddle of the see / And were bothe cast in / and anon about the shyppe aroos a grete tempeste and about them was grete calme and tranquylite / whan they thenne that were in the shyppe were aferd to be perisshed / and repented them of the harme and wyckednes that they had cōmysed in the seyntes / Nazaryen

And fond hym etyng a man / And she cast on hym holy water / & shewed to hym the crosse / whiche anon was ouercomen and stondyng stil as a sheep she bonde hym wyth her owen gyrdle / and thenne Was sleyn with speres and glayues of the peple / the dragon was called of them that dwellyd in the contre tharasconus wherof in remembraunce of hym / that place is called tharasconus whiche tofore was called verlue and the blacke lake / by cause there ben wodes shadowous and black / and there the blessyd martha by lycence of maxymyne her mayster and of her suster duellyd and abode in the same place

noble lygnage born in y e cite ancerre And was taught and enformed wel in the artes lyberalle / And after he went to rome / For to lerne the scyence of the decretees droytes & lawe And there receyued he so moche of dygnyte / that the senate sent hym vnto ffraunce for to haue and obtayne the dygnyte of the duchy of alle burgoyne And thus as he gouerned the cyte more dylygently than al the other / ther was in the myddes of the cite a tre whiche was a pyn / On whiche men henge on the braunches for the grete merueyle of theyr huntyn / the hedes of wyld bestes / but seynt Amadour whiche was

his bedde was alle enuyronned with asshes / and hayre and with a sacke / And had not hys hede adressyd vpon a pyllowe more hyer than his sholdres / but euery day he wepte and bare aboute hys necke relyques of seyntes he ware none other clothyng / he ware solde hosen or shoon / and selde was gyrde / and the lif that he lyued was aboue / mānes power / hys lyf was suche that it was grete myracle and pyte to see his flesshe and was a thyng not credyble / and dyde so many myracles / that but yf his merytes had goon byfore / they shold haue ben trowed fantastique / On a tyme he was herberowed in a place / where euery nyght the table was made redy for to ete after souper whan men had souped / and he was moche admerueyled therof / and demaunded of the haost of the hous / wherfor they made redy so to ete after souper / And thoost sayd to hym that it was for his neyhbours / whiche wold come and drynke one after that other / and that nyght Seynt Germayn establisshed hym to wake for to see what it was / It was not long after that the and cam to the table in guyse of men and wymmen And whan the holy man sawe them / he commaunded them that they shold not goo away / and after he sent for to wake the neyhbours on alle sydes in suche wyse that euery body was founde in his bedde / and in theyr houses / and made the peple to come and see yf they knewe ony of them / but they said nay And thenne he shewed them that they were deuylles / wherof the peple were moche abasshed / by cause the deuylles had mocqued them soo / •euyne that Germayn •unged his wif in to his suster / and retorned so his body by the space of xxx yere / that he neuer ete •e cam theder a grete multitude of deuyls And thenne seynt Germayn coniured that they neuer after retorned thyder ne cam more there / That same tyme seynt lupe floured whiche was bisshop of Troyes / the cite was assyeged of the kyng attyla / and seynt lupe went vpon the gate / and cryed and demaūded what he was that so letted them To whom he sayde I am attila y e scorge of god / and thenne the meke bysshop answerd and said / and I am lupe Alas the waster of the flocke of god And haue nede of the scorge of god & commaunded thenne to opene the gates And the peple of the kyng attil god so that they passyd thrugh the toun and sawe no man of y e cite ne dyd no harme to ony body / Thenne the blessid germayn toke wyth hym seynt lupe / and they both went in to bretayne / where as the heresies thenne were / but whan they were on y e see a grete tempest cam and aroos / whiche by the preyer of seynt Germayne anon cessed / & thenne they were receyued honestly of the peple of the contre / whos comyng deuyllys had sayde to for whiche seynt Germayn had cast out of bodyes that they had vexed / and whan they had ouercomen the heresies / they retorned agayn vnto theyr owne places / On a tyme it happed that seynt germayne lay seek in a strete / whiche strete was afyre / To wh and desyred to bere hym out of the strete for drede of the fyre but he wold not be born thens But put hym self ayenst the fyre whiche brente all about hym / & touched not hym ne the hous that he was in / Another tyme he retorned in to bretayn for the heresyes / one of his disciples folowed hym hastely and fyl seek by the waye and deyed there / and whan seynt germayn retorned / he demaunded to see the sepulture of hys dysciple that was deed / and it was opened to hym And he called hym by his name / and demaunded hym what he dyd and made and yf he wold dwelle ony more with hym / and anon the body spacke and seyd that he was wel / and al thynges were swete to hym / and wold nomore be callid agayn in to this world he said / And the seynt graunted hym that he shold be in reste / and l and slepte in our lord / He preched on a tyme in brytayn so moche that the kyng denyed hym lodgyng & his peple / Thenne it happed that the kynges kowherd went wyth hys porcion that he fette atte paleys & bare it to his lytil hous / And he sawe the blessyd Germayne and his men seche their lodgyng where they myght he herberowed that nyght / And the Cowherd brought them in to his hows / & sawe that they had moche hongre / But he had not mete ynough for hym and for hys ghestes / This Cowherde had but one calf / whiche he dyd doo slee for to gyue to them / And he receyued them debonayrly with the litil good that he had / And whan they had souped & had sayd graces / Seynt germayn bad hym brynge to hym the bones of the calf / and to laye them vpon y e skynne And after made his prayer to god / and anon the calf aroos to lyf without taryeng / and on the morn seint germayn cam hastely to the kyng / and demaunded hym why he had denyed hym lodgyng / Thenne the kyng beyng sore abasshyd coude not answere / Thenne he sayd to the kyng goo out / and leue thy royame to one better than thou art And thenne seynt germayn ordeyned the cowherd to be gouernour of the royame / Thenne as the saxons fought ayenst the brytons / and sawe that they were but a fewe men and sawe the holy men passe by them / they called hem and the seyntes prechyd so moche to them that they cam to the grace of bapteme and thrugh brennyng charyte of fayth purposed to fyghte / & whan that other partye herd that they purposed to goo ayenst them hardely / And seynt Germayn hyd hym self aparte with his peple / & warned them whan he shold crye / Alleluya / that they shold answer / Alleluya / And whan the sayde seynt germayn had cryed / Alleluya / And the other had answerd / Theyr enemyes had so grete fere / that they cast away alle theyr armours / and had wend veryly that alle the montayns had fallen on them and heuen also / and so al affrayed fledde awaye / On a tyme as seynt germayn passed by augustynence / and went to the tombe of seint cassyen and enquyred of hym how it was with hym / And he answerd hym out of the tombe and sayd / I am in swete reste / and abyde the comyng of our redemer / and he said agayn / reste thou thenne stylle in the name of our lord / and pray for vs deuoutly that we may deserue the holy Ioyes of the resurrection / And whan Seynt germayn cam in to rauenne he was receyued moche honourably of the quene placida / And of valentynyen her sonne / and at the houre of souper she sent to hym a right grete vessell of siluer / ful of delycious mete / the which he reteyned for to gyue to pour men / And in stede herof he sent to the quene a dysshe of tree / and a barley loof / the whiche she receyued gladly / and after dyde do couere the dysshe with syluer and kepte it long wyth grete deuocōn On a tyme whan the lady had boden hym for to dyne wyth her / he graunted it debonayrly / and bycause he was wery of traueyle / and fastynges he rode from hys hostel vnto the paleys vpon an asse / and whyles he dyned his asse deyed / And whan the quene knewe that his asse was dede / She was moche sorouful / and dyd do presente to hym a ryght good hors of right grete beaute and grete / & whan he sawe hym so rychely aourned and arayed / he wold not take it / but sayd shewe me myn asse / For he y t brought me hyther shal bryng me home / And went to the deed asse / and said arise & late vs retorne home / & anon he aroos and awoke as he had slepte and as he had had no harme / and thenne Seynt germayne mounted on his asse & r departed fro rauenne he sayde / that he shold not belong in thys world / and a while after he fyl seek of the feuers or accesse / and the seuen day after passyd out of thys world vnto our lord / and hys body was borne in to ffraunce / lyke as he had desired of the quene / and he deyed aboute the yere of our lord / CCCC / & xxj / Seynt germayn had promysed to seynt Eusebye whiche was bysshop of versayle / that whan he retorned he wold halowe his chirche that he hed founded / And whan seynt eusebe vnderstode that he was deed / he wold hym self halowe his chyrche and dyd do lyght the tapres / But the ofter they lyght them / so ofte they went out / and were quenchyd / and whan Seynt Eusebe sawe this / he apperceyued well that the halowyng was doon / or ellys it shold be doon an other tyme / or it shold be reserued to an other bysshop / and whan the body of seynt germayn was brought to versayl assone as his body was brought in to the chyrche alle the tapers were lyght by them self by goddes grace / Thenne seynt eusebe remembred of the promesse of Seynt germayne / and that whiche he had promysid lyuyng / He accomplisshed i deed / But it is not to be vnderstande that this was the grete eusebe bysshop of versayl / That this was don in his tyme / ffor he deyed vnder valent themperour / And fro the deth of hym vnto the deth of seynt germayn was more than fyfty yere / • were alle made blynde by the wyl of •m• the people cam •yde doun his hede • And on ester day they cast of theyr armour / •de to hys lodgyng / but er he • beyng But thys was another Eusebe vnder whom this thyng was don / Thenne late vs praye vnto thys holy germayn that he praye for vs to god almyghty / that after this lyf we may come to euerlastyng blysse in heuen Amen / Thus endeth the lyf of Seynt Germayn Here nexte foloweth the lyf of Seynt Eusebe / And first of his name / EUsebe is sayde of eu / whiche is as moche to say as good / And sebe that is eloquence or stacōn / Or Eusebe is as moche to saye as worshyp / he had bounte in sanctificacion / Eloquence in defense of the faith stacion in the stedfastnes of martirdom And good wyrshyppyng in the reuerence of god / ¶Of seynt Eusebe EUsebe was alway a vyrgyne / and whyles he was yet yonge in the fayth he receyued bapteme and name of Eusebe the pope / In whiche bapteme the handes of angellis were seen that lift hym out of the fonte On a day a certayn lady was esprised of his beaute / and wold haue goon to his chambre / And thangellis kepte the dore in suche wyse that she myght not entre / and on the morn she went to hym and kneled doun at his feet / and requyred of mercy and foryeuenes / of that she had ben in wyll to haue made hym synned / and he pardonned her debonayrly / And whan he was ordeyned to be a preest / he shone in so grete holynesse / that whan he sang the solempnytees of the masses the angellys serued hym / After this whan the heresye of the arryans had enfected al Italye / / and Constantyn themperour fauouryng them / Iulyus the pope sacred Eusebe in to bysshop of versaylle the cyte / the whiche helde the pryncipate of the other citees in Italye / and whan the heretiques herd say that / they shitte faste the doores of the chirche / whiche was of our blessyd lady and blessyd virgyne seint marie / thenne the blessyd saynt knelyd doun / and anon the dores opened by his prayer / Thenne put he out eugenyen bysshop of melan / Whiche was corrumped of this euyll heresye / and ordeyned in hys place denys a man / right catholyque / And thus Eusebe purged alle the chirche of thoccident / And anastase purged thoryent of the heresye arryen / Arrius was a preest of Alysaunder / whyche sayd and affermed that cryste was a pure creature / And sayd that he was not god / and for vs was made / that we by hym as by an Instrument were made of god / And therfor constantyn ordeyned a counseyl at nycene / where as this errour was condempned / And after this arryen deyed of a myserable deth / For he voyded alle his entrayles bynethe at this foundement / and Constancien sone of constantyne was corrupte with thys heresye / For whyche cause this constancien had grete hate ayenst Eusebe / And assembled a counseyl of many bysshoppis / And callyd denys and sent many lettres to eusebe and he knewe well that the malice of hym was so grete that he daygned not come to hym / wherfore themperour establisshed ayenst thexcusacion of hym / that the counseyl shold be solempnysed at mylane whiche was nygh to hym / and whan he sawe that eusebe was not there / He commaunded to the Arryens that they shold wryte theyr fayth / and send it to Denys bysshop of Melane / and xxix bysshoppes he made subscrybe the same fayth / And whan Eusebe herde that / he yssued out of his cite for to goo to mylane / And sayd wel to fore that he shold suffre moche / And thus as be cam to a flood for to goo to mylane / the shyppe taried longe on that other syde of the Ryuer but the shippe cam at his cōmaūdement And bare hym ouer & his felawshyp without gouernour / Thenne the forsayd denys cam ayenst hym and kneled doun to his feet and requyred pardon and whan Eusebe coude not be torned by yeftes ne by menaces of this Emperour / he sayd tofore them alle / ye say that the sonne is lasse than the fader wherfor haue ye thenne made my sonne and my dyscyple gretter than me / for the dyscyple is not aboue the maistre / ne the sonne aboue the fader / Thenne were they meuyd by this reson / And shewed to hym the wrytyng that they had made and denys had wreton / & they sayd that he had wreton / And he sayd nay / I shal not subscrybe after my sonne / to whom I am souerayn by auctorite / but brenne thys writyng / And after write another yf ye wyll / er I shalle write / and thus by the wyl of god that cedule was brent whyche denys and the xxix bisshops had subscrybed / and thenne tharcyens wrote agayn another cedule / and delyuerd it to Eusebe and to the other bysshoppes for to subscrybe / but the bysshoppes enhardyed of Eusebe / wold in no wyse consent to subscribe / but they were glad that thylke cedule which by constraynt they had subscrybed was brente / thēne was constancien angry / and delyuerd Eusebe to the wylle of tharcyens / and anō they drewe hym fro the myddle of the bysshoppes / and bete hym cruelly and drewe hym fro the hyest of the palays by the stappes doun to the lowest and fro the lowest to the hyest vnto the tyme that hys hede was al to brused and bledde moche blood / And yet he wold not consente to them / and thenne they bond is handes behynde hym / & after drewe hym with a corde aboute his necke / and he thanked god and sayd that he was alle redy for to deye for the defence of the fayth of holy chirche / Thenne constancien exyled liber had enhardyed / And thenne thareyens ledde Eusebe in to Ierapolyn a cite of palastyne / and enclosed hym in a strayt place in so moche that it was strayt and short that he myght not stretche out his feet / ne torne hym fro one syde to a nother / and he had hys hede so strayt that he myght not meue it / ne torne hither ne thyder his mombres in no maner sauf only his sholdres & armes / the place was so strayt in lengthe and in brede / And whan Constancien was dede / Iulien suc hym / •eded And wold plese euery man / and commaunded that alle the bisshoppes whyche had ben exyled shold be repeellyd / And the temples of the goddes to be opened and wold that alle men shold vse peas / vnder what lawe he were / And by this occasion Eusebe yssued out of pryson / and cam to Athanase and tolde to hym what he had suffred / Thenne Iulyen deyde / And Ionynyen regned / And tharcyens sessed / Seynt Eusebe retorned to the toun of versayll / where the peple receyued hym wyth grete Ioye / And after whan valent regned tharryens cam agayn in to theyr forces / and entred in to the hous of Eusebe / and stoned hym wyth stones / and so put hym to deth / And deyed debonayrly in our lord / And was buryed in the chyrche that he had made / and it is said that he Impetred and gate grace of our lord that none arcyen myght lyue in that cite / And after the cronyques he lyued lxxxviij yere / He floured aboute the yere of our lord CCC & l •en the pope / Denys / Paulyn / and alle the other bysshoppes that Eusebe Thus endeth the lyf of seynt Eusebe / Here foloweth the seuen machabees / There were vij machabees with theyr worshipful moder / And a preest named eleazar / whiche wold ete no swynes flesshe by cause it was defended in theyr lawe / And after that it is conteyned in the fyrst book of the makabees / they suffred grete tormentis & suche as neuer were herd to fore / and it is to vnderstonde that the chirche of the Oryent maketh the solempnytees of the seyntes of that one and of that other testament / and the chyrche of the occident / maketh no feste of them of tholde testamente / sauf of the Innocentes / by cause that the soules of the seyntes of that tyme descended in to helle / but she maketh feste of the innocentes by cause that Ih̄u was slayne in eueriche of them / and also of the machabees / and there ben iiij resons wherfor the chirche maketh solempnytes of the machabees / how be it that they descended in to helle / amd aboue that ony other of the olde testament haue suffred / And therfor ben they preuyleged / that their passyon be solempnysed by theyr merite And this reason is sette in scolastyca historya / The seconde reason is for the representacion of the mysterye / the nomber of vij is vnyuersal & generall And by them be vnderstonden and signefyed alle the faders of tholde testament worthy to be solempnysed / And how be it that the chyrche maketh not solempnyte of them / by cause they descēded in to helle / And also bycause that there cam so grete a multitude of newe seyntes / neuertheles in thise vij is don reuerence to them alle / • The first reason is bycause they had prerogatyue of martirdom not tofore lyke herde / For as it is sayd by the nombre of seuen is assygned an vnyuersite / The thyrd is bycause of thensample of suffryng / And there ben purposed in ensample of good crysten men for two thynges that is to saye / the constance after the constance of them they ben enhardyed in the loue of the faith / and also for to suffre for the lawe of the gospell / lyke as they dyd for the lawe of moyses / The fourth reson is for by cause of theyr tormentis / For they suffred suche tormentes for theyr lawe that they helde for to deffende / like as crysten men doo for the lawe of the gospell / And mayster Ioh̄n beleth assygneth thise thre last resons in hys somme of the offyce / Thus endeth it of the machabees / Here foloweth the feste of seint Peter / ad vincula at lammas THe feste of seynt peter thappostle that is callyd ad vincula was establisshed for foure causes / That is to wete in remembraunce of y e delyueraunce of seynt peter / And in mynde of delyueraunce of Alexander / For to destroye the custome of the paynems / And for to gete Absolucion of spirituel bondes / And the fyrst cause whyche is in remembraunce of saynt peter ffor as it is said in thistorie scolastyque / that herode agrippe went to rome and was right famylier with gayus neuewe of tyberius Emperour And on a day as herode was in a chariote brought with gayen / he lyfte vp his handes in to heuen / And sayd I wold gladly see the deth of this olde felawe Peter / and the lord of alle the world / and the chariot man herd this word sayd of herode / And anon tolde it to tyberyus / wherfor Tyberyus sette herode in pryson / And as he Was there he behelde on a day by hym a tree / and sawe vpon the braunches of this tree an owle whiche satte theron / and another prysonner whyche was with hym / that vnderstode well dyuynacions sayde to hym / Thou shalt be anon delyuerd and shalt be enhaunsed to be a kyng In suche wyse that thy frendes shalle haue enuye at the / and thou shalt dye in that prosperyte / And knowe thou for trouthe / That whan thou shalt see the Owle ouer at the ende of fyue dayes after thou shalt dye for certayn / And anon after Tyberyus deyed / And Gayus was Emperour / whiche delyuerd heroude out of pryson / and enhaunsed hym gloryously / and sent hym as kyng in to Iudee / and anon as he cam he sent hys puyssaunce / and sette hand to / For to put somme of the chyrche to affliction / and dyd doo slee Iames brother of seynt Iohan theuangelyst with a swerde byfore the day of ester / And bycause it was a thyng agreable and plesed the Iewes / He toke Peter on ester day / and enclosed hym fast in pryson / And wold after ester bryng hym forth and shewe hym to the peple and slee hym / but thangel cam merueyllously / and vnbond hym and losed his chaynes / and sent hym forth alle quyt to the seruyse of prechyng the word of god / And the felonny of this kyng suffred not tabyde ony discicion of vengyance / For the next day folowyng he made to come the kepars / For to begynne to tormente them with dyuers paynes for the fleyng of Peter / but he was lette to doo that / that the delyueraunce greued thē not / For he went hastely to Cezarie / And there was smeton of an angelle and deyed / Thus reherceth Iosephus in the booke of antyquyte / For whan he rode cam in to Cezaree / alle the men & wymmen of that prouynce cam to hym And whan the day cam that he shold goo in Iugement and take possessyon of the contray / He went and cladde hym with a vestment of tyssue merueylously shynyng of golde and siluer And whan the sonne smote and shone on it / It was more shynyng than the sonne / For it was so bryght / that no man myght beholde it / And the brightenes was lyke rede metal / and gaf fere and drede to them that loked theron / and therfor the pryde of hym was so grete / that he better semed a man made by crafte / than by nature humayn And thenne the peple began to crye & say / we haue seen the tyl now lyke a man / But now we confesse that thou art aboue nature humayn / And thus as he was flatred with honours / and reffused not dyuyne worshippes / he beyng there sette he sawe aboue his hede an owle syttyng / whiche was messager of his hasty deth / And whan he had apperceyued the owle / And byheld the peple that were there assembled and comen at his commaundement / he sayd to them / certayn I that am youre lord shalle deye wythin fyue dayes / For he knewe it well / bycause the deuynour had told hym that he shold deye within fyue dayes that he had see the owle syttyng aboue hym / And Incontynent after this thyng thus accomplisshed he was smeten sodanly in suche wise that wormes ete his bowels and on the fyfte day deyed / And this sayth Iosephus / And bycause thenne in remembraunce of the delyueraunce of Seynt Peter prynce of thappostles fro the cruel vengaunce of the cruel tyraunt / whyche assone as he was enhaunsed to be kyng / went to pursewe and destroye the chirche / therfor the chyrche haloweth the feste of Seynt Peter advincula / And the epystle is songen in the masse in whyche thys delyueraunce is witnessed here to be doon / The second cause of thestablyssyng of thys feste / was by cause Alysaunder the pope whiche was the vj after Peter / And hermes prouost of rome whiche was conuerted to the fayth by the same Alexander were holden in dyuerse places in the pryson of quyryn the Iuge / whiche Iuge sayd to hermes the prouost / I merueylle of the that art so wyse a man / that thou wilt leue the grete worldly honours that thou hast / and the grete richesses that thou receyuest of thy prouostye / And wylt leue alle thyse thynges for dremyng of an other lyf / To whom hermes sayd / to fore thys tyme I despreysed and scorned / ¶ And wend there had ben none other lyf than this Quyrynus answerd / Make prouf to me that there is an other lyf / & anon I shalle applye me to thy fayth / To whom hermes sayd / Allexander whom thou holdest in thy pryson / shalle enforme the better than I / Thenne quyryn cursyd Alexander / And sayde to hym / I wyll that thou shalt make proef of thys thyng to me / and thou sendest me to Alexander / whom I hold bounden in chaynes for his euyll dedes Truly I shalle double the pryson vpon the and alexander / and I shalle sette watche vpon you / And yf I fynd the with hym or hym with the / I shal verely gyue fayth to thyn and his wordes And thenne he doubted theyr kepars / And shewed this to Alexander / and thenne alexander prayed to god / And an angelle cam to hym and brought hym in to the pryson to hermes / And whan quyryn cam to the pryson He fond them both to gydre / wherof he was moche admerueylled / & thenne hermes recounted to quyryn how Alexander had heled his sonne and reysed hym fro deth / And quiryn thenne sayd to Alexander / I haue a doughter named balbyne / wyiche is seek of the goute / yf thou mayst hele her / I promyse the that I shal receyue thy fayth / yf thou mayst gete for her helthe / To whom alexander sayd / Goo anon and bryng her to me in to my pryson / And quyryne sayd to hym / how may I fynd the in thy pryson and art here And Alexander sayd goo thy waye anon / For he that brought me hyther shalle sone bryng me theder / And Quyryn went thenne and fette hys doughter / And brought her in to the pryson where Alexander was / & fonde hym there / and thenne knelyd doun to hys feet / And his doughter began to kysse the chaynes with whyche seint Alexander was bounden hopyng therby to receyue her helth / And Seynt Alexander sayd to her / Doughter kysse not my chaynes / But seke the chaynes of seynt Peter and kysse them wyth deuocion / And thou shalt receyue thy helthe / And anon Quyryn dyd do seche the chaynes of Seynt Peter / and they were founden / And Alexander dyd the doughter do kysse them / And anon as she had kyssed them she receyued her helth and was alle hool / Thenne Quyryn demaunded pardon & foryeuenes / And delyuerd Alexander out of pryson / and receyued the holy bapteme he and alle hys meyne and many other / Thenne Alexander establysshed this feste to be halowed alleway the first day of august / And dyd doo make a chyrche in thonour of seint peter where as he sette the chaynes And named it seynt peter ad vincula / and to that chyrche come moche peple at that solempnyte / and the peple kyssed there the bondes and chaynes of seynt peter / The thyrde cause of thys establisshement after bede is this and Octauyan were so conioyned to gydre by affynyte / that they departed bytwene them two thempyre of the world / Octouyen had in thoceydent ytalye ffraunce and spayne / And Antoyne had in the eest / Asye / Ponte and affrique / Anthoyne was wylde Ioly / and rybauldus / and had the suster of Octauyen to his wyf / And left her and toke cleopatra which was quene of egypt / and for this cause Octauyen had hym in grete despyte / And went wyth force of armes ayenst Anthoyne in Asye / And ouercam hym in alle thynges / Thenne Anthoyne and Cleopatra fledde as vaynquysshed / And slewe them self by grete sorowe / And octauyen destroyed entierly the royame of Egypte / and made be vnder the Romayns ¶ And fro thens he went in alle the hast he myght in to Alexandrye / • Antoyne And despoyled it of alle rychesses and brought them to Rome / And encreased so the comyn prouffyt of Rome / That there was gyuen for one peny that / whyche to fore was sold for foure / And bycause the batayles of the peple / had wasted and destroyed the cyte of Rome / he renewed it sayeng / I fond it couerd wyth tyles And I shalle leue it now couerd wyth marble / And for thyse causes he was made emperour / And the fyrst that euer was callyd Auguste / And of hym ben alle other that come after hym called Augustes / Lyke as after his vncle Iulyus Cezar they ben called Cezariens / Also thys moneth of Auguste whyche tofore was called Sextilys The peple entituled it to hys name & callyd it Angustus / in thonour and rememberaunce of the victory had the first day of thys monthe / In so moche that alle the Romayns made that day grete solempnyte vnto the tyme of Theodosye themperour / whyche began to regne the yere of our lord CCCCxxvj / Thenne Eudosie doughter of the sayde Theodosyen Emperour and wyf of valente / went by a bowe to Iherusalem / And there a Iewe gaf to her for grete loue a grete yefte / ¶ And they were the bondes that is to wete the ij chaynes / wyth whiche Seynt Peter vnder herode was bounden wyth / Wherof she was moche Ioyous / And whan she retorned to rome / she sawe that the Romayns halowed the fyrst day of august in thonour of an Emperour Paynem whyche was deed / thenne was she moche sorouful / by cause they dyd so moche honour to a man dampned / And thought that they myght not lyghtely be wythdrawen fro thys custome / But yf she myght so moche doo she wold not leue it thus / But that it shold be made in thonour of Seynt Peter / And that alle the peple shold name that day / the day of Seynt Peter ad vincula / •e of the Emperour that he And herof she had collacōn with seynt Pelagyen the pope / And brought them wyth fayre wordes to that / that the remembraunce of the prynce of paynems was forgoten / And the memorye of the prynce of thappostles was halowed / And it plesed ryght well to alle the people / Thenne she brought forth the chaynes whyche she had brought fro Iherusalem And shewed them to alle the peple / And the pope brought forth the chayne wyth whiche he had be bounden vnder Nero / ¶ And assone as that chayne touched that other / alle thre by myracle were but one / lyke as they had be neuer but one / Thenne the pope and the quene establysshed that the folisshe relygyon of the peple makyng solempnyte of a Paynem were chaunged in to better / And was made of Seynt Peter prynce of thappostles / And the pope and the quene sette the chaynes in the chyrche of seynt Peter ad vyncula / And were gyuen of the quene to the sayd chyrche ryght grete yeftes / and ryght fayre preuyleges / and it was establysshed that day to be halowed ouer alle / ¶ And thys is that lede sayth / And Sygybert also sayth the same of thys thyng / And of what grete vertue thys chayne is / It apperyth wel in the yere of our lord foure hondred and xl iiij / There was an erle whiche was nyghe to the Emperour Octone that was so cruelly vexyd and tormented with the deuyll to fore alle the peple that wyth his owen trethe he bote and tare hym self / And by the commaundement of themperour he was ledde to pope Ioh̄n for to put the chayns aboute hys necke And there was a nother put aboute hys necke of thys wode man and demonyake / And it dyd hym none alegement / By cause it had no vertu / And atte last the very chayne of Seynt Peter was broughte and put aboute the necke of the sayde man Demonyake / But it was of suche vertue that the deuyl myght not bere it / But departed and went out cryeng tofore them alle / Thenne Theodoryke bysshop of Mets toke that chayne / and said he wold not departe fro it in no maner but yf his hand were cut of / & for this cause was grete descorde bytwene the pope and the bysshop and the other clerkes / And atte laste the Emperour appeased the noyse And gate of the pope that he had a lynke of the chayne / And he kepte it moche Worthely in grete deuocion / Mylet also recompteth in his cronyque / And is wreton in thystorie tripertite that in that tyme there was a grete horryble dragon whiche apperyd at empyrum / And the bysshop donat and kylled hym forthwith / but that bysshop made tofore the signe of the crosse with his fyngres vpon the dragon / For he was so grete that there behoued seuen cople oxen to drawe hym thens out of the toune / in to a place where he was brent for by cause y e stenche of hym shold not corupt the ayer / yet sayth the same mylet / & also it is sayd in thystorye tripertite / that the deuyl apperyd in a toune named creta in the semblaunce of moyses And this creta is nygh to a montayne whiche is nygh to the see / & assembled a grete multitude of Iewes of alle places / And brought them to the toppe and hyest of the montayne / & promysed them to lede them and to goo drye foot with them vppon the see in to the londe of promyssyon / And there he assembled peple wythout nombre / And some byleue that the deuyl had despyte of the Iewe that had gyuen this chayne to the quene by whyche the feste of Octauyen cessed to be made / And whan the deuyl sawe that he had there of the Iewes wythout nombre aboue y e grete montayne / He made many falle doun from the toppe to the ground bynethe / And made of them wythout nombre to be drowned in the see / And thus the deuyll aduenged hym on them / And many of them that escaped bycam cristen / ffor whan they wold haue goon vp on the montayne wyth the other they myght not go vp so sharpe roches / in suche wyse that they that went vp were alle to cutte with the stones / And the other were drowned in the see / and weren alle deed / And whan the other wolde haue doon the same / and tarryed by cause they wyst not what was happed of the other / certayn fysshers goyng by them told what was fallen of the other / and thus they that myght escape retorned and wente not after the other / And al thise thynges ben conteyned in the said historye / The fourth cause of the Instytucion of this feste may be assygned here in this wyse / delyuerd seynt Peter out of his chaynes by myracle / And gaf hym power to bynde and vnbynde / ffor we be holden and bounden vnto the londe of synne / and haue nede to be assoyled / Therfor we worship the solempnyte of the chaynes afor sayd / For as he deserued to be vnbounde of the bondes of his chaynes / so receyued he power of our lord Ih̄u crist to assoyle vs / And thys last reson may be lyghtly apperceyued For thou seest that thepystle accordeth thabsolucōn and losyng of the chaynes made to thappostle / And the gospell recordeth the power that was gyuen to hym for tassoyle / And thoryson of the dethe requyreth that absolucion be made to vs / And thys that somtyme he gyueth absolucion / And assoylleth the dampned otherwhyle by the power of the kayes whiche he receyued / It apperyth in a myracle of the blessid virgyne marrie / On a tyme there was a monke a scolyer whiche was in the cyte of coloyne in the monastery of seynt peter whiche monke was synful and whan this monke was supprysed with sodeyn dethe / the deuyllis accused hym and cryed on hym that he had don alle maner synnes / That one sayd I am couetyse / whiche so oft thou hast coueyted ayenst the commaundement of god / And another sayd I am vayne glorye of whyche thou hast enioyed the in makyng a vaunte emong men / And another sayde I am thy lesyng in whiche thou oft syn lyeng / And other in lyke wyse / • • • spytte in his mouth / • For our lord •edest in And contrarye to them some good werkys that he had don excused hym sayeng / I am obedyence / whyche thou dydest to thyn elders and soueraynes / Another sayd I am the song of psalmes that thou hast songen to god moche ardantly / & seint peter to whom he was a monke went to god for to pray for hym / and our lord ansuerde to hym / hath not the prophete sayd by my Inspyracion / Onē

is not entred wythout spotte / Ne hath doon no rightwisnesse / And yet peter prayed for hym with the blessid virgyne moder of god / Thenne our lord gaf vpon hym this sentence / that the soule shold retorne agayn to the body and that he shold doo penaunce / And thenne seynt peter with the kay that he held in his hond fered the deuyllis / and made them to flee / and after delyuerd the soule to a monke of the same monastery / and commaunded hym that he shold bryng it to the body / and he bare it to hym / and requyred of hym for his rewarde that he had brought it agayn that he shold say euery day for hym the psalme Miserere mei deus / and that he shold of te swepe his sepulture & kepe it clene / And thus he reuyued fro the deth and cam agayn to the world / and dyde hys penaunce / and / recompted to alle the peple this that had happed to hym / Thenne late vs praye this gloryous appostle seynt peter to be our aduocate to our lord Ihesu cryste / that we may by the power of the kayes

vincula / Here foloweth the lyf of seynt Stephen the Pope / WHan seynt stephen the pope had conuerted many of the paynems vnto the cristen fayth both by word and by example / and had also buryed many bodyes of the marters in the yere of our lord two hondred & lx he was sought by grete studye of valeryen and of galyen thenne empereurs For by cause that he and his clerkes shold doo sacrefyse vnto theyr ydolles or ellis to be slayne by dyuers tormentis / and the sayd emperours made ordynaunce / that who someuer broughte them / he shold haue all theyr substaūce and for that cause x of his clerkes were taken / and brought forth / and anon wythout audyence were byheded And the day folowyng seynt Stephen the pope was taken and brought to the temple of mars theyr god / to thende that he shold adoure and doo honour to thydolle / or ellys he shold haue sentence to be byheded / But whan he was entred in to the temple he prayed to our lord Ih̄u cryst that he wold destroy the temple / and anon a grete party of the temple fylle / And alle they that were there / ffledde for drede that they had / and thenne he went to the Cymetoyre of seynt luke / and whan valerien herd that / he sent to hym mo knyghtes than he dyd tofore / and whan they cam they fond hym syngyng masse / And anon he fynysshed deuoutly that which he had begonne / And that doon the byheded hym in his seete / • ¶Thus endeth the passyon of seynt Stephen the pope / Here foloweth thynuencion of seynt Stephen prothomartir / THe Inuencion of the holy body of seynt Stephen prothomartir was made in the yere of our lord iiijCxvij in the xvij yere of honorius themperour / The Inuencion of hym the translacion / and the coniunction were made by ordre / For a prest named lucyen of the contray of Ih̄rlm / Of whom gerard recompteth emong the noble men and wryteth thus / that on a fryday Whan he was in his ledde & rested / and vnnethe awoke / He sawe an auncient man of noble stature wyth a long berd wyth a semely vysage enuyronned in a Whyte mantel / In whiche there were litil ouches & crosses of gold tissued / he was hosed wyth hosen browdred with gold aboue which helde in his honde a rodde of gold / wyth whiche he touched hym and sayd Goo and with grete dylygence opene our tombes / For We ben leyde in a place dyshonest and of despyte / Goo thou therfor vnto Ioh̄n the bysshop of Iherusalem / and say to hym that he lay vs in a more honourable place / And by cause that drought and tribulacion is thrugh the world / God hath ordeyned to be debonayr and merciful to the world by our suffragyes and prayers And lucian sayd to hym / Syre who art thou / I am sayd he gamaliel which norisshed thappostle poule & enseygned hym the lawe of my faders / And he that lyyth with me is seynt Stephen whiche was stoned of the Iewes / and cast out of the cite for to be deuoured of the bestes and byrdes / but he kepte hym to whom he kepte his fayth wyth out hurtyng / And I wyth grete dylygence toke vp the body / & With grete reuerence buryed it in my newe tombe And that other that lyeth with me is Nychodemus my neuewe whiche went by nyght to Ih̄u cryst / and receyued bapteme of Peter and Ioh̄n / & therfor the prynces of prestes were āgry wyth hym / and wold haue sleyne hym / but that they lefte atte reuerence of vs Neuertheles they toke away alle hys substaunce / and deposed hym from his pryncypate / and bete hym strongly & lete hym lye for deed / And thenne I ledde hym in to my hous / where he lyued after but a fewe dayes / and whan he was deed I buryed hym atte feet of seynt stephen / And the thirde that is wyth me is abybas my sone whiche in the xx yere of his age receyued bapteme wyth me / And Was a clene virgyne / and lerned the lawe of god with my disciple poule / And Ethea my wyf and selemus my sone whyche wold not receyue the fayth of Ih̄u crist were not Worthy to be in our sepulture thou shalt fynd them buryed in a nother place / And shalt fynd theyre tombes voyde and ydle / and whan he had sayd all this / seynt Gamaliel vanysshed away / And thenne lucyan awoke and prayed to god yf this vysyon were trewe / that it myght be shewed yet the second tyme and the third tyme / and the nexte fryday after folowyng / he appered lyke as he dyd tofore / and said to hym wherfor hast thou desdayn to do that whiche I haue requyred the / and he sayd to hym / Syre I haue no desdayne / but I haue prayed god / yf it be in his name / that it apere to me yet onys agayn / and Gamaliel said to gym bycause thou hast thought in thy corage / that yf thou fynd vs how thou myghtest deuyse the reliques of eche of vs / I shalle ensigne the of eueriche by symylitude to knowe the tombes and reliques of eche of vs / and thenne he shewed thre panyers of gold and the fourth of siluer / of the which that one was ful of rede roses / the other tweyne of white roses / And the fourth whyche was of siluer was full of saffron / and gamalyel sayd to hym thyse panyers ben our tombes / & these roses ben our reliques / and the first ful of rede roses is the tombe of seynt Stephen / whiche only of vs alle deserued the crowne of martirdom / The other tweyne ful of White roses ben the tombes of me and nychodemus Whiche perseuered with a clene herte in the confessyon of Ih̄u cryste / and the fourth of siluer whiche is ful of saffron / is of abybas my sonne / Whiche shyneth by whytenes of vyrgynyte / and yssued out of this world pure & nette / and this sayd he vanysshed away / and the fryday after that weke folowyng / he apperyd to hym agayn alle angry and blamed hym greuously of his delayment and necligence / And anon lucian went to Iherusalem / and recoūted alle by ordre to Ioh̄n the bysshop / and called the other bysshops / and wente to the place that was shewed to lucien and Whan they had begon to delue / & meued therthe a ryght swete sauour Was felt / And by the merueyllous flauour and swetenesse / and by the merites of the sayntes lxx seke men Were heled of their Infirmytees / And thus the reliques of thyse seyntes Were transported in to the chirche of syon whiche is in Iherusalem / In the whiche seynt stephen vsed thoffice of tharchedeken / And there were they ordeyned for right honourably / In the same houre descended fro heuen moche rayne / and of thys vision and inuencion bede maketh mencion in his cronyke / and this Inuencōn saith seynt bede was in the same day y t his passyon is halowed / and his passyon as it is sayd was the same day also But the festes haue ben chaunged by double reson / The first reson is by cause that Ih̄u cryste was borne in erthe / that man shold be born in heuen / therfor it apperteyneth that the feste of Seynt stephen shold folowe the natyuyte of cryst / ffor he was first marterd for criste for to be born in heuen / and so it signefyeen that the one folowe that other / & therfor it is songen in the chirche / yesterday cryst was born in erthe / that thys day stephen shold be borne in heuen / the second reson is that the feste of the Inuencion is more solempnly made than the feste of his passyon / & that is only for the natyuyte of our lord Ihu cryste Neuertheles our lord hath shewed many myracles in thynuencion of hym / And bycause his passyon is more worthy than his Inuencion / therfor ought it to be more solenpne / and therfor the chyrche hath transported his passyon to the tyme in which it is had in gretter reuerence / And as seynt austyn sayth the translacion of hym was in this maner / Alexandre senatour of constantynople went with his wif to Iherusalem And made there a fayre oratorye to Seynt stephen the first martir / & after his deth he dyd hym to he buryed by his body / and seuen yere after Iuleane his wyf wold retorne in to her contrey / by cause that the prynces did to her wrong And wold carye wyth her the body of her husbond / and whan she had made long requeste to the bisshop with many prayers / The bysshop shewed to her two tombes of siluer & sayde to her / I wote not whiche of thise tweyne is thy husbond / And she sayd to hym / I wote wel / and went hastely / and enbraced the body of stephen / And thus by caase of fortune / whan she wend to haue taken the body of her husbond / She toke the body of the prothomartir and whan she was within the shippe wyth the body / there was herd hymnes and songes of angels / and a right swete odour / and the deuyls cryed & menyd grete tempest sayeng / Alas / Alas / ffor the fyrst martir stephen passyth her by / which beteth vs cruelly with fyre / and the maronners were in grete doubte & cryed on seynt stephen / And anon he appered to them and saide I am here / doubte ye nothyng / and anon grete peas was and fayr weder in the see / Thenne were there herd the voys of deuyls cryeng felon prynce brenne thys shyppe / For stephen our aduersayre is within it with that the prynce of deuillis sent fyue deuyllis for to brenne the shippe / but thangel of our lord plunged them doun in the grounde of the see / and whan they came to caladoyne the deuyllis cryed sayeng / the seruaūt of god cometh whiche was stoned to deth of the felon Iewes / Thenne came they in sauete in to Constantynople / & the body of seynt stephen was brought with grete reuerence in to a chirche / and this sayth seint Austyn / the coniuncōn of the body of seynt stephen wyth the body of seint laurence was made by this ordenaunce / It happed that throdociane doughter of theodocien themperour was gretly tormented thith a deuyl / & whan it was told to her fader / whiche was at constantynoble / he commaunded that his doughter shold be brought thyder / and that she shold touche the relyques of seynt stephen the first martir / And the deuyl cryed within her / yf stephen come not to rome / I shalle not yssue out of her / For it is the wyl of thappostles / and whan themperour herd that / he Impetred and gate of y e clargy and peple of constantynoble / that they gaf to the romayns the body of Seynt stephen / and they shold haue therfore the body of seynt laurence / And the emperour Wrote to pelagyen the pope / vpon Whiche the pape by the counseyl of the cardenallis consented to the request of themperour / and thenne went the cardynallis to constantynople and brought to rome the body of seynt Stephen / And the grekes cam for to haue the body of seynt laurence / the body of seint stephen was receyued in to capuan whyche gate by theyr deuoute prayers the ryght arme / and buylded theyre chirche metropolitan / that is to say tharchebysshops see in thonour of hym / and whan the romayns were comen to rome they wold haue borne the body of seint stephen vnto the chirche of seynt Peter ad vincula / they that bare it stode styll and myght goo no ferther / And the deuyl whiche was in the mayde cryed ye traueyle you for nought / For he shal not be here / but with laurence his brother where as he is / And for thys muse was the body born thyder / And the mayde touched the body and was alle hool / and seynt laurence as enioyeng hym of the comyng of his broder and smylyng torned hym in to that other parte of the sepulcre and made place and lefte half the place voyde / And whan the grekes sette theyr hondes for to haue born away laurence / they fyl doun to therth as they had ben deed / but the pope and the clerkes prayed for them and alle the peple / & yet vnneth with grete payn cam they to lyf agayn at euensong tyme Neuertheles they were alle deed within x dayes after / and the latynes & alle they that so consented entred in to frenesye and myght not be hool vnto the tyme that the two bdyes were entombed to gydre And thenne Was there a voys herd fro heuen that sayd / O blessyd rome which hast enclosed in one tombe the glorious Iewels / the bodyes of seynt laurence of spayne and of seynt sttephen of / Iherusalem / This coniunction was made aboute the yere of our lord ixCxxv / Seynt austyn recounteth in the xxij book of the cite of god / that vi deed bodyes were reysed by the Inuocacion and prayers of seint stephen / that is to wete that there was one / that lay deed / and the name of seint Stephen was called ouer hym / and he was anon reysed to lyf / Also there was a child whiche Was sleyne With a cart and Was anon raysed to lyf / And there was a nonne whiche was at her last ende / and was born to the chirche of seint stephen / and there dyed in the syght of all the peple and after she aroos alle hool / Also a mayde of yponence / of whom her fader bare her cote to the chyrche of seint Stephen / and after leyd it on the body of the deed mayde / and anon she aroos / And a yong man of yponence deyed / Aut anon as the body of hym was enoynted with the oyle of seint stephen he aroos to lyf / Another chyld was born deed to the chirche of seint stephen and by the merites of Seint Stephen was anon restablisshed te lyf / and of this precious martir saith seint austyn Gamaliel mayster of the scole / and wyth a stole a boute his necke made reuelacion of hym / Saul dispoyled & stoned hym / Ihesu criste wrapped in poure clothes enriched hym / and crowned hym With his precious blo and stones / & Seynt stephen shone in beaute of body in floure of age / in fayr speche of reson wisdom of holy thought in werkes of deuynyte he was a strong pyler of the fayth of god / For whan he was taken and holden with tonges emong the hondes of them stoned hym / In the fornais of fyre of fayth he was destrayned / smeton demened and beten / the fayth encresed and was not vaynquysshed / And Seint augustyn saith in an other place vpon this auctorite hard brayne he was not flatred / but put out / He was not tasted / but hurte / he fered ne trembled not / but was chauffed and in an other place he saith thus / be hold stephen thy felaw / he was a man as thou art / and of the masse of synne as thou art / and brought with the same prys that thou were / he was dekene and radde the gospel / that thou redest or herest / There he fond wreton loue your enemyes / And this blessyd prothomartir seynt Stephen lerned in redyng / and prouffyted and accomplysshed in obeyeng / Thenne late vs praye deuoutly to hym that he praye for vs to that blessid lord for whom he suffred deth / and prayed for them that pursiewed hym / that he pray for vs / and that we may fel called Paul the holy doctour and appostle Amen / • whom his moder bare to the chirche of Seynt stephen / •de • theffecte of his prayer lyke as saule dyde whyche after was Thus endeth Thinuencion of Seynt Stephen prothomartir Here foloweth of seynt domynyk / and first of his name / DOmynyk is sayd as a kepar of

domynycus / as kepte of our lord Our lord kepte hym in his thre folde state / of whom the first is / that he was a lay man / In the second he was a chanon reguler / And the thyrd as appostle / ffor in

gaf alleway lasse to his body than it desyred or appetited / Of Seynt Domynyk Frere and prechour / DOmynyk was duke of the ordre of the freres prechours and a noble fader of the parties of spayne / of a toun named callorega of the diocise of oxonyence / and his fader was named ffelix / and his moder Iohane / of whom he cam as of the flesshe and his moder tofore that he was born sawe in her slepe that she bare a lytell whelpe in her bely / whiche bare a brennyg brond in his mouthe / and whan he was issued out of her wombe / He brent alle the world / and also it semed to a woman that was godmoder to hym at font and helde hym y t the chyld domynyk had a sterre right clere in hys forhede which enlumyned al the world And as he was yet a chyld and in the kepyng of his nourice / he was ofte founde leuyng his bedde and lyeng on the bare grounde / And after Whan he was sent to palentyne for to lerne / he tasted ne dranke neuer wyne in x yere And whan he sawe that grete famyne was there he sold his bokes and al his substaunce / and gaf the prys of them to poure peple / & whā his good renome grewe / he was made chanon reguler of the bysshop of oxonyence in hys chyrche / And after he was myrrour of lyf vnto the peple / and was ordeyned subpryour of the chanonnes / and day and nyght he entended to rede / in prayeng god cotynuelly that he wold gyue hym grace that he myght estende to the helthe of his neyghbours / In the boke of collacōns of faders he redde curyously and toke therin grete perfection / he went wyth the sayd bysshop to tholous / And there he reprehended his hoost of heresye / and conuerted hym to the fayth of Ihesu cryste / And presented hym to our lord / as an handful of the first fruyte of the to comyng haruest / It is redde in the gestys of the erle of mounfort / that on daye as seint domynyk prechyd ayenst the heresyes / that he put in writyng the auctoritres that he purposed / And delyuerd the cedule to an heretike for to argue ayenst hys obiections / and that nyght the heretikes assembled at the fyre / & shewed to them that sedule / and they bad hym to cast it in the fyre / And yf the cedule brenned theyr fayth was not but trecherye / And yf it brenned not / thenne he prechyd the very fayth of the chirche of Rome / And thenne was the cedule cast in the fyre / And whan it had be in the fyre a whyle / it sprang out al sauf / And thenne one of them that was more hard than the other sayd cast it in agayn yet / And we shal preue better and more playnly the trouthe / Thenne it was throwen in agayn / and it yssued out agayn without brennyng / Thenne sayde he late it be cast in the thyrde tyme / And thenne shal We knowe without doubte the yssue of this thyng / and it was caste in agayn / And it cam out the third tyme without lesyon or hurte / And yet the heretikes abydyng in theyr hardnesse sware emonge them fermlye that none of them shold publisshe this thyng / neuertheles a knyght that was there whiche was somwhat accordyng to our fayth disclosed this myracle / & it is sayd asemblable thyng happed at the mount victorial in the temple Iupiter / that a disputacōn was ordeyned ayenst the heretikes / lyke as the maladye of theresye grewe in the Partyes of albegeys / that disputacion solempne was at the temple of Iupyter / & Were ordeyned Iuges on both patyes / To Whom thaffyrmacion of the fayth that eueriche shold ensygne shold be wreton in a book / And the book of seynt domynyk was chosen and presented emong the other / Vpon the Which the Iuges stroof ayenst them / how be it It was ordeyned that the bokes of one parte and that other sholde be caste in to the fyre / And they that brenned not shold be holden with out doubte for the very fayth / and so the bokes were throwen in to a grete fyre brennyng And anon the book of the heresyes Was brent / and the book of seynt domynyk only was saued and not brente / But sprang out of the fyre without hurtyng and it was cast in the second tyme / and it lepe owt wythout brennyng / And after thys the other cristen men went home agayn to theyr proper places / and the bysshop of oxonyence deyed / and seynt Domynyk abode there allone with a fewe crysten men and catholyque ayenst the heretikes / And denounced & preched the worde of god fermely And thaduersaryes of trouth mocked hym / and spitte at hym / and threwe at hym filthe of the stretes and other right foule thynges / And bond behynd hym wyspes of strawe in grete despyte / And whan they thretened & menaced hym / he answerd Wythout fere or drede / I am not worthy to be marterd / ne I haue not yet deserued that deth by glorye / And therfor he passyd hardyly by the way where they despised hym / and song and Went Ioyously / And they merueyled & sayde to hym / hast thou no drede of deth / what woldest thou haue doon yf we had taken the / I had prayed you said he / that ye shold not haue slayne me sodenly / But lytil and lytil ye shold haue hewen membre fro membre / one after a

fond a man that for the grete pouerte that he suffred was Ioyned to the heretykes / and seynt domynyk seeyng this / ordeyned hym self to be solde / and that the prys of hym shold be gyuen to the pour man to bryng hym out of his pouerte / And this dyd he for to bryng hym of the foul errour that he was in / And so he wold haue ben sold yf not the deuyne mercy had not otherwyse pourueyed Another tyme a woman cam to complayne to hym that her brother was in the hondes of the sarasyns in grete captyuyte / And that she knewe no way how to delyuer hym / And he was meuyd of pyte in hys herte / And offred hym self to be solde for the redempcyon of that other / But god that knewe hym more necessarye for the redempcyon spirituel of many caytyues suffrid it not / & yet he entended to be his pledge and to lye for hym / his charite was so grete / In a tyme he was lodged With certayn ladyes whiche by occasion of relygyon they had be desceyued of the heretiques / and thenne he fasted and his felawe with hym al the lente with brede and water / so that by the shadowe of relygyon he toke fro them that errour / and in the nyght he woke sauf whan necessyte was / he lay doun vnder a table without other thyng / And thus thise wymmen were brought to the knowleche of trouthe / and thēne began he to thynke of thestablisshement of his ordre / & of what offyce it myght be / For to goo and preche thrugh the world / and for tenhaunce the crysten fayth ayenst the heretikes / And whan he had dwellyd x yere in the parties of tholouse after the deth of the bisshop of oxonyense / vnto the tyme that the counseyl shold be solempnysed at latranense / Thenne he Went to rome with Faucon bysshop of tholouse to the counseyl generall for to gete of Innocente the pope that the ordre whiche is sayde the ordre of the prechours myght be confermed to hym & to hys successours / And the pope wold not lyghtely accorde to this thyng / And thenne it happed on a nyght that the pope sawe in a vision that the chirche of latronense Was sodenly menaced for to falle and ouerthrowe / and as he behelde it alle aferd / he sawe on that other syde / seint domynyk rennyng ayenst it & susteyned / and bare it vp and kepte it and thenne awoke the pope / and vnderstode the vision and receyued Ioyously the peticōn of the man of god And badde that he and his brethern shold seche somme Rewle approued / & he wold conferme it at his wyll / and thenne seynt domynyk cam to hys brethern and shewed to them What the pope had sayd / and they Were of nombre / aboute xvj or xvij freres / whiche anon called counseyl of the holy ghoost and chosen the rule of seynt Austyn prechour and holy doctour / and wold of one wyl be in dede and name prechours / & establisshed therwith somme customes more strayter in their lyuyng whiche they toke aboue / and promysed to kepe them truly / In this tyme Innocent the pope deyed / and honorius was made pope and souerayn bisshop of the chirche / and he gate of the same honorius the confirmacion of his ordre in the yere of our lord a MCCxvj / And on a tyme as he prayed at rome in the chirche of seynt peter for thencreacyng of his ordre he sawe comyng to hym the glorious prynces of thappostles Peter and poule / And hym semed that Peter gaf to hym the staffe first / And seynt poul delyuerd to hym the book & they sayd to hym / goo and preche / For thou art chosen of god to doo that occupacion / and mynysterye / and in a litil moment hym semed that he sawe hys sones sprad thrugh out the world two and ij prechyng to the peple the worde of god / For whiche cause he cam agayn to tholouse / and departed hys brethern somme to paris / somme in to spayne / And other to boloyne / and he retorned agayn to Rome / There was a monke byfore thestablysshement of this rauysshed in spirite and sawe the blessed virgyne our lady Seint marie knelyng with her handes ioyned prayeng her sonne for the humayn lygnage / and he ofte Withstode her requeste / and atte last he sayd to her that so besily requyred hym / moder what may I doo more for them / I haue sent to them patriarkes and prophetis / and litil haue they amended them / after I cam to them my self / and after that I haue sent to them appostles / And they haue sleyn them / I sent to them also martirs / confessours and doctours And they accorded not to them ne to theyr doctryne / but by cause it apperteyneth not to me / to wythsay thy request I shalle gyue to them my prechours / by whom they may be enlumyned and made clene or ellys I shal come ayenst them / my self yf they wyl not amende them / And another sawe that same tyme whan the xij abbottes of y e ordre of Cystews were sent to tholous ayenst the heretikes / For Whan the sone had ansuerd to his moder as is aboue said The moder sayd to hym / Fayr sone thou oughtest not to doo to them after theyr malyce / but after thy mercy / To whom the sone vaynquysshed by her prayers sayd / I shalle yet doo to them mercy at thy requeste / For I shal sende to them my prechours / that shal warne and enforme them / And yf thēne they not correcte them / I shalle spare them no more / A Frere menour that longe tyme had be felow with seint fraunsoys recounted to many of the freres of the ordre of the prechours / that whan seint domynyke was at rome for the confirmacōn of his ordre of the pope / he sawe on a nyght Ih̄u crist in thayer holdyng thre speres in his hande / and brandysshed them ayenst the world / and his moder ran hastely ayenst hym / and demaunded hym what he wold doo / And he sayd to her / alle the world is ful of vyces / of pryde / of luxurye / and of Auarice / and therfor I wil destroye them wyth thyse thre speres / Thenne the blessyd virgyne fyll doun at hys feet and sayde / Dere sone haue pyte / And tarye thy Iustyce by thy mercy / & Ihesu cryste sayd to her / seest thou not how many wronges and Iniuryes they do to me / and she answerd / Sone attempre thy wrath / and tarie a lityll I haue a trewe seruaunt and a noble fighter ayenst the vyces / whyche shalle renne oueral & vaynquysshe the worlde and subdue them vnder thy seygnorye And I shal gyue to hym a nother seruaunte in to hys helpe that shal fight as he doth / and our lord her sone saide I am appeased and receyue thy prayer but I wold see / whom thou wilt sende in so grete an offyce / And thenne she presented to hym seynt domynyk / And Ih̄u cryste sayde / truly thys is a good and a noble fyghter / and shalle doo dilygently that thou hast sayd / And thenne she shewed to hym and offryd to hym seint ffraunsoys / and he preysed hym / as he dyd the first / And Seynt Domynyk consydered dylygently hys felawe in that vysyon / For he had neuer seen hym byfore / and he fond hym on the morne in the chyrche / and knewe hym by that he had seen hym in the vysyon wythout other shewer / & began to kysse hym / and sayd thou art my felawe / thou shalt renne wyth me / & we shalle be to gydre / and none aduersarye shal surmounte vs / And thenne he recounted to hym alle by ordre the sayd vysion / and fro then forthon / they Were one herte and one soule in our lord / And commaunded that this loue shold be kepte to them that shold come after them perdurably / And whan on a tyme Seynt domynyk had receyued a nouyse in to thordre / Some that had ben his felawes peruerted hym / in suche wyse that he wold retorne to the world / And demaunded after his gowne / and whan seint domynyk herd that / he went to prayer / and as the yong man had despoyled hym of his relygyous clothyng / and they had don on hym his sherte / he began to crye wyth an hye voys and saye / I chauffe I brenne / certaynly I am alle brente / doo of / doo of this cursed sherte whiche brenneth al my body / And myght not endure in no wise til he was despoyled of this sherte and clothed agayn wyth his relygyous clothes / and brought agayn in to the cloystre of the religious And whan seynt domynyk was at boleyne / what tyme the freres were goon to slepe / A frere conuerse began to be tormented of the deuyl / and whan ffrere Reyner of losanne knewe it / he sayde it to seynt domynyk / And seynt domynyk commaunded that he shold be brought in to the chyrche tofore the aulter of our lady / & x ffreres myght vnnethe bryng hym / And thenne said Seynt domynyk / I coniure the wicked spyryte that thou telle to me wherfore thou vexyst thus the creature of god And wherfor and how thou entredest here / And he answerd I vexe hym / ffor he hath deserued it / He dranke yesterday in the cite without lycence of the priour / and made not the signe of the crosse theron / and I entred thenne in signe of a botel to thende that he shold drynke me With the wyn the sonner / Thenne it was founden that he had dronken in the toun / And in the mene whyle / he made the signe of the crosse and they ronge to matyns / and whan the deuyll herd that / he sayd I may no lenger abyde here / Syth they with the grete hoodes aryse / and thus he was constrayned by the prayer of Seynt domynyke to yssue and goo hys waye & the frere was delyuerd and hool / and was wel ware euer after to doo ayenst the wyl of the pryour / And as seynt domynyk on a tyme cam to a ryuer toward the parties of tholouse / his bookes Whiche had a custodye fyl in the water / and coude not fynde them / but must leue them behynd hym / And the thyrd day after / a fisshar cast his hoke in to the water / and supposed to haue teken vp som grete fysshe / And drewe vp the bookes of seynt domynyk with out ony wetyng / lyke as they had ben kepte dylygently in an almarye / and on a tyme Whan he cam to a monasterye / And al the brethern were at reste / and he Wolde not destrouble ne awake them / he put hym to prayer / & entred in with his felawe / the yates beyng shette and closed / also in lyke wise in the conflicte of theretikes as he was with a conuerse of the cystews in an euentyde and cam to a certayn chyrche / and fonde hit shytte and closed / he made his prayers & sodenly they were in the chyrche / and abode there all that nyght in prayer / And whan he had prayed he had alway a custome to staūche his thurst at sōme welle or fontayn lest he shold haue ony desyre to drynke in the hous of his hoost / There was a scolier in the hows of the freres at boloyne for to here masse / and hit happed that seynt domynyk sang the masse / & whan it cam to the offryng the scolier Wente and kyssed the honde of Seynt domynyk with grete deuocion / & whan he had kyssed it / he felte come out of his honde so grete swetenes / and so swete an odour / as he euer had felte to fore in his lyf / and fro than forthon the Ardeur and brennyng of lecherye began to wexe colde in hym / so that he whiche tofore had ben vayn & lecherous was after so contynent / that his flesshe shone alle of clerenes and chastite / and the flesshe of seynt domynyk shone moche of grete chastyte and purete / of whom the odour cured the filthes of the thought / ¶ There was a preest which sawe seynt domynyk so ardantly in his predycacion With his felawes / and he concluded in hym self that he wold Ioyne hym to them / yf he myght haue a book of the newe testament / necessarie to hym for to preche / and as he thought thys / there cam a yong man beryng a book of the newe testament to selle vnder his vestement / and anon the preest bought it with grete Ioye / But as he doubted yet a lytil he made his prayer to almyghty god / & made the crosse vpon the book without forth and sythe opened the book and loked within forthwith / & the first chappytre that he fonde was in the actes of thappostles / that / Whiche is sayde to Peter cam first to his syght / which was this Arise vp descende and goo with them nothyng doubtyng / For I haue sent them / Thēne he went and Ioyned hym to them / On a tyme whan a noble mayster in scyence and in fame was regent in tholouse in theologye / On a mornyng tofore the day whyle he purueyed his lessons / he was surprised with slepe / and enclyned hym on his chayer a lytil / and hym semed that seuen sterres stode tofore hym / and as he merueylled of the nouuelte of this / the said sterres grewe sodenly in to so grete lighte that they enlumyned all the world / and whan he awoke / he was strongly amerueylled / and whan he entred in to the scoles / and as he redde / seynt Domynyk with vj freres of the same habite entred and cam amyably to hym / & shewed theyr purpoos and said / that they coueyted to haunte his scoles / Thenne this mayster remembred hys vision / and doubted not but thise were the seuen sterres that he had seen / Whan saynt domynyke was on a tyme at Rome / Mayster Reynold of saynt Aman deene of Orleaunce / which was wyse in the lawe Canon / And hadde ben fyue yere doctor was comen with the bisshop of Orleaunce to the see / for to passe in Rome / And hadde ben long in purpoos for to haue lefte the world / and to entende to prechyng / but he was not yet auised how he myght accomplisshe it / and when he had herd thynstytucion of thordre of the prechours of a cardynal / to whome he had told his will he called saynt domynyke / and exposed to hym his purpoos / And thenne he hadde counseylle to entre in to the ordre / But withoute taryenge he was taken with so greuous sekenes / that he was in despayr of his helthe / And thenne saynt domynyk prayd hertely to oure blessid lady / the vyrgyne / to whome he had commysed alle the ordre / that she wolde gyue to that deen helthe for a lytel tyme / And sodenly the quene of mercy cam with thre maydens / And Reynold wakyng / and abydyng the dethe / sawe her come to hym / and oure lady sayde to hym / be of good chere / requyre of me What thow wylt / And I shalle gyue it to the / And as he thought what he shold requyre / one of the maydens saide to hym softely / that he shold requyre nothyng / but to commytte hym alle to her wille / 〈◊〉 fallyng / 〈◊〉 whiche was And whan he hadde so done / thenne she put forthe her vyrgynal honde / and touched his eres his nosethrellis / mouth handes / feet / and raynes / and enoynted them with the oynemente of helthe Whiche she had brought with her in sayeng propyrly the forme of the wordes / whiche apperteyne to the membres And she sayd to the raynes / these raynes be restreyned with the girdel of chastyte / And thenne she torned to the feet And sayd I enoynte these feet / in preparacion of theuangely of pees / And she said / I shalle sende to the an Ampulle / for to restablysshe the to ful helth And thenne she shewed to hym the habyte of the ordre / and sayd to hym / This is the habyte of thyne ordre And saynt domynyke beyng in prayer sawe alle this vysyon / And on the morn saynt domynyke cam to hym / and fond hym all hoole / And herde of hym alle the ordynaunce of the vysyon / and he toke thabite that the vyrgyne shewed to hym / For to fore the freres vsed surplys / And the thirdde daye the moder of god was there / and enoynted the body of Reynold that she took not only awey the hete of feuers / but also extyncted and quenchyd the ardour of luxurye / lyke as he confessyd after / that one only meuyng of luxurye was not after in hym / And this vysyon sawe ageyne a relygyous man of the hospytal with his owne eyen / beyng present saynt domynyk / and was astoned therof / And this vysyon seynt domynyk publysshed to many bretheren after this dethe / Thenne was reynold sente to boloyne and entended moche ardauntly to prechyng / and encreaced the nombre of the freres / And after that he was sente to parys / And a whyle after he deyed in oure lord / There was a yong man of the Cardynal esteuen fylle with his hors in to a dyche / And was drawen oute therof all deed / and offryd to saynt domynyk And he made his prayers / and the yong man restablysshed to lyf / In the chirch of saynt Sixte A mason had be hyred of the freres / for to repayre the broken walles / And a pece of the wal fyl vpon the man / and slewe hym / but saynt domynyke commaunded / that the body shold be brought to hym / And anone by the helpe of his prayers / he was restablysshed to lyf and to helthe / In the same chirche at rome on a tyme there were fourty freres / and they had but lytel brede / Thenne saynt domynyke commaunded to put the brede in thre partyes / that there was / And as sone as eche of them had broken a morselle of brede with ioye / there cam two yōg men of y e same habite & forme whiche entrid in to y e refectory or fraitour & the lappes of their mantels y e henge on their neck were ful of brede & whā they had gyuen it al fully to seynt domynyk they departed so sodēly / y t none of them wist whens they cam ne whider thy wēt & thēne seynt domynyk gaf forth with his hād here & there to the freres & said Now ete my bretheren / Whan saynt Domynyke on a tyme was in his iourneye greuously troubled with greete floodes of rayne he made / the signe of the crosse / and chaced awey the rayne fro hym / and fro his felawe lyke as he had a pauyllon vpon hym / and the grounde was al weet aboute hym / And no drope cam nyghe hym the space of thre cubites / On a tyme as he passid by shyppe toward the partes of thoulette / the shipman demaunded of hym a peny for his passage / And the holy man of god promysed to hym the kyngdome of heuen / for his labour sayeng that he was the disciple of Ihesu crist / And that he bare neyther gold n And he drewe hym forsybly by the cope / and said thou shalt leue here thy cope / or thow shalt paye to me a peny / The good mā of god lyft vp his eyen to heuen / and a lytel / •raid And as he had a lytell thought / he loked vpon the ground / & sawe a peny / whiche withoute doubte was procured by the wylle of god / Thenne sayd he / loo my broder take hit there / and lete me goo in pees It happed on a tyme / that whan this holy man seynt domynyke was in hys vyage / A relygyous man / whiche was of good conuersacyon / and holy acompanyed with him but he was of a straūge langage / And they were sory / that they couthe not vnderstonde eche other / for to comforte eche other / And they prayd and gate grace of oure lord / that in thre dayes that they wente to gyder / what by signes / and what by wordes eche of them vnderstode / what that other mente / Ther was a man / whiche was vexyd with many deuylles / And was offryd and brouʒt to hym And he took a stole and put it about his owne necke / and after bounded aboute the necke of the demonyake / and commaunded them that were in hym / that fro thens forthon they shold tormente nomore that man / and anone they were tormented within hym / and baganne to crye / late vs goo / wherfore constreynest thou for to be so tormented And he sayd / I shalle not lete yow goo / tylle ye haue gyuen to me pledge that ye shalle not retorne ageyne / And they sayd what pledge maye we gyue to yow / And he sayd the holy martirs that resten in yonder Chirche / And they sayde / we may not / For enmerytes requyre it not / And he sayd ye muste nedes gyue them / or I shalte not suffre yow to goo quyte / And they answerd / that they wolde done theyr payne / And a lytell whyle after they sayd / how be it / that we be not worthy / We haue goten that the hooly martirs shalle be oure pledges / And he requyred them to haue a signe and token of this thyng / And they said / goo to the shryne / where the heedes of the martirs ben / and ye shalle fynde them / reuersed and torned / And thenne he wente / & fond lyke as they had said / And as he prechid on a tyme / somme ladyes / that had ben deceyued of heretykes at his feet / •••eled and sayde to hym / Seruaunt of god / helpe vs / yf it be trewe that thou prechest / The spyryte if errour hath blynded oure synnes / • syluer / ne money / And he said / be ye forme / and tarye a lytell / and ye shalle see / what lord ye haue serued / ¶ And anone they sawe sprynge oute of the myddell of them / a Catte right horryble / whiche was more than a greete dogge / And had grete eyen and flawmyng Her tonge longe brood and blody / and longe vnto the nauel / He had the tayll short / and reysed vp on hyghe / and shewed the after end / whiche way he torned hym / Oute of whiche ther yssued a terryble stenche / And when he hadde torned hyther / and thyder among the ladyes longe / At the laste he mounted vp by the belle rope in to the steple / and vanysshed awey leuyng a grete stenche after hym / And the ladyes thanked god / and were conuerted to the feyth Catholyque / when he had / ouercomen somme heretykes in the partyes of thelouse / And they were condempned to be brente / he sawe one among them / whiche was named Reymond / And he saide to the mynystres / kepe ye thys man that he be not brente in no maner with the other / And thenne he sayd to hym / spekyng swetely to hym / I knowe wel sone / that thou shalt yet be a good man / And he was lefte / and abode twenty yere in his euylle heresye / & in thēde he was conuerted / and was a Frere prechoure in that ordre / and fyuysshed his lyf well and laudably / And as he was on a tyme in spayne accompanyed with somme freres / he sawe in a vysyon a right grete dragon / whiche swolowed in to hym the bretheren that were with hym / And when he vnderstode this vysyon / he warned his bretheren to resiste strongly the fende their enemy And a lytel whyle after / alle the freres / excepte frere Adam and two Conuersys departed from hym / And he demaunded one of them / yf he wolde go also / And he saide nay fader / I shalle not loue the hede / for to folowe the feete And anone he gaf hym self to prayer / and conuerted almost al by his prayer He was at saynt Syxte on a tyme at Rome / And sodenly the hooly ghooste lyghted on hym / And he called hys bretheren in to the chappytre / And said apertely to fore them alle / that foure of his bretheren sholde deye shortely / two in body / and tweyne in sowle / And anone two freres deyde in our lorde / And tweyne departed oute of thordre He was on a tyme at Boloyne / and a frere an Almayn born named Conrade with hym / whome the freres desired moche to haue in to thordre / And as saynt domynyk spak to the pryour of cassamarye of the Cystews in the Vygyle of thassumpcyon of oure lady of certeyne mater / And he saide to hym by amyable affyaunce / I telle to the pryour a thyng / whiche I neuer yet said to no man / ne thou shall neuer telle hit / as long as I shalle lyue ¶ and that is this / I neuer yet requyred thyng of god in this lyf / but that I had my desyre / and the said pryour saide to hym that perauentur he sholde deye byfore / And saynt domynyk by the spyryte of prophecye saide to hym / that he sholde lyue long after hym / And the pryour sayde to hym / Fader / requyre mayster cōrade / that he gyue hym self in to thordre For the Freres desyre hym moche / And he saide / broder thou requyrest a moche harde thyng / Thenne whan complyne was sayde / the other freres wēt to reste / And he abode in the chirche / & dyde as he hadde be acustomed alle the nyght to be in oryson and prayer / And when the freres assembled at pryme / And the chaūtor bagan Iam lucis orto / Maister Conrade cam sodenly / which desyred to be sterred with newe lyghte and fylle donne alte feet of saynt Domynyk / And requyred thabyte of thordre / And receyued it perseuerantly / And he was right relygyous / and a gracyous lector ofte in thordre / whiche as he lay in deyeng / and had c deed And he opened his eyen / And lokyng aboute sayde / Dominus vobiscū / which is to saye / oure lorde be with you And they answerd / Thy spyryte be with god / And thenne saide he / Alle Cristen sowles by the mercy of God / maye reste in pees / And forthwith he deyde and rested in oure lorde / Seynt domynyk was of moche stedfast equalite of thought / but yf he had be meued by pyte and by mercy / For he had a ioyous herte / a peasyble vysage of a mā within forthe / the conpunction appered outward / and that shewed debonayrte / In the day tyme / ther was none more comyn to his felawes and bretheren in al honeste / And atte houres in the nyʒt and in his prayers / ther was none more stedfaste / The day he departed to his neyghbours / And the nyght to god / his eyen were lyke a welle of teres / And ofte whan oure lordes body was lyfte vp atte masse / he was so rauysshed in his mynde / as he hadde sene Ihesu crist in his flesshe / For whiche cause / he wolde not moche here masse with the other / he had a custome right comune / for to wake all the nyght in the chirche / In suche wyse / that solde he rested in his bed for to slepe / & whan he was wery and necessite of slepe / constreyned hym / He rested hym tofore an aulter enclyned / or haue a stone vnder his heede / he receyued wyth his propre hande thre tymes in the nyght discyplyne with a chayne of yron that one for hym self / y e other for y e synners y t ben in the worlde / & the thirde them that ben tormented in purgatorye He was on a tyme chosen to be bisshop in Coreacense / but he refused vtterly affermyng to leue rather the erthe / than to consente to thelection / that was made to him / It was asked of him on a time wherfore he duellyd not more gladly in the dyocese of thoulete than in the diocise of carcossone / And he sayd that in the dyocise of thoulette / I fynde moche peple whiche honoure me / And in carcassone it is al the contrarye / For ther alle men assaylle me / It was demaūded of hym by a man / In what booke he moost studyed / and he answerd / in the book of charyte / On a tyme the holy man Domynyke woke in the chirch of Boloyne / And the deuyll appyered to hym in the forme of a frere / And seynt domynyk had supposed that he had ben a frere / and made hym a signe that he shold goo to rest with the other freres / And he made to hym signes ageyn in mockyng hym / Thenne saynt domynyke wolde knowe / what he was that soo despysed his commaundement / and lyghted a candel atte lampe / and behelde hym in his face / And he confessid that he was the deuyll / And whan he had blamed hym strongly / anone the deuyll enioyed hym / that he had made hym broken his scilence / And saynt domynyk sayd / that he myght well speke as prioure and mayster of the freres / And constreyned hym to say / wherof he tempted the freres in the quyer / he sayd / I make them to come late / and to goo oute erly / Thenne he brought hym in to the do and aryse late / and thus I kepe them fro dyuyne seruyce / and in the mene whyle to haue vnclene thoughtes / And after he ladde hym in to the refectorye or fraytour / and demaunded hym / wherof he tempted them there / And thenne the deuylle sprange vppon the tables / and sayd oftymes / now more / now lasse / And when the seynt asked hym what he mente therby / he said I tempte some freres to take moche mete / by whiche they be lette to doo goddes seruyce / and somme that they take lasse / than they shold doo / for to make them ouer feble to kepe the obseruaunces of their ordre After he brouʒt hym in to the parloure or locutorye / and demaunded hym wherof he tempted the bretheren there / thenne he put oute his tonge ofte / and made a merueylous sonne of confusyon / And the saynt demaunded hym what he mente therby / And he sayd / this plare is al myn / For whan the freres ben assembled to speke / I tempte them that they speke confusedly / and that they medle wordes withoute prouffyte / and that one tarye ne abyde not tille the other haue spoken / And atte laste he brought hym to the chapyter / but when he was tofore the dore of the chappytre he wold in no wyse entre in / And sayde / I shall not come in there neuer / For this is a cursed hows / and is helle to me / For what someuer I wynne in other placys / I lese all here for when I haue made ony frere to synne by ony neglygence / he purgeth hym anone of that neglygence in this place of malediction / and accuseth hym to fore alle the bretheren / For they be here warned Confessed / accused / beten / and assoylled / And I here lese all / wherof I sorowe / for lesyng of that I ioyed to haue wonnen in other places / And when he had sayde al this he vanysshed away / And in the ende when the terme of his pylgremage approched / he was at boloyne / And beganne to languysshe by greuous infirmyte of hys body / And the dissolucion of his body was shewed to hym by a vysyon / for he sawe a right faire yonglyng / whiche called hym and said thus / Come my frende / come to Ioyes / come / And thenne he assembled twelue freres of the Couent of Boloyne / And to thende that he wold not leue them / and disheryted / and orphanes / he made his testament and sayd / These ben the thynges / that I leue to yow / possede by ryghtfull herytage / as to my sonnes / Fyrst to haue charyte / to kepe humylyte / to possede voluntary pouerte / and exhorted as moche / as he myght straytely that there shold be none temporelle possessions in his ordre / ¶ And that he that shold presume to touche and fowle the ordre of frere prechours with erthely rychesses / he prayd ferdfully / that he shold haue the maledictyon and curse of god almyghty / and of hym ¶ And the Freres made moche sorowe of his departynge / ¶ And he in recomfortyng them swetely sayd / My brethern late not my departyng trouble yow / and doubte ye nothyng / For ye shal haue me more profytable deed than lyuyng And he cam to his last hour in the yere of our lord MCCxxj / And so slepte in our lord Ihesu cryste / whos departyng out of this world was shewd the same day and the same houre to the frere general thenne priour of the prechours of bryxia / And afterward to the bysshop of the same cyte in this manere / For as he slepte a lyght slepe the heed enclyned to a walle / he sawe the heuen opene / and put doun to the erthe two whyte laddres / Of which Ihesu cryste & his moder helde the ende on hygh / And the angels descended & ascended by the ladres syngynge In the myddes of the ladders there was a sete sette / And vpon the sete satte saynt domynyk with his heed coured lyke a frere / ¶ And Ihesu cryste and his moder drewe vp the laddres in to heuen so hye / that he that sat / was lyfte vp in to heuē / & thēne the opnyng of heuen was shette & closed / ¶ And thenme the same frere cam to boloyne / And fonde that the same day and the same houre saynt domynyk deyed / There was a frere named raoul which was that tyme that he deyd at tybur / And wente to the aulter to synge messe / ¶ And whan he cam to the canon in which is remembred the lyuyng men / he thouʒt to pray for the helthe of saynt domynyk / And sodenly he was rauysshyd in his mynde and sawe the holy man saint domynyk crowned with a crowne of gold laureate / ¶ And goyng oute of boloyne by the waye royall / And thenne he marked the day and houre and fonde that saynt domynyk was thenne deed / And whan the body of hym had leyen longe vnder erthe / And myraclees shewd whythoute seassyng / And that his holynesse myght not be hydde / Ther yssued and cam out of the place where he laye a right grete odour the same tyme whan his tombe was opned wiche was bonden with yron bondes and instrumentes and semente / And the stone take away & the body translated to an hyer place / And the odour surmounted alle aromaty And y t was not only in the bones of y e holy body / But in the pouldre and cheste and in alle therthe aboute was lyke sauour / In suche wyse as the erthe was born in to fer regyons / And reteyned longe the same odour / And this odour also abode in the handes of the freres that had touched somme thynges of the holy relykes / that how wel that they were wasshen and fro And bare wytnesse of the swete flauour and eyer ¶ In the prouynce of hongrye a noble man / His wyf and his sonne wente to visite in a chyrche the relikes of saint domynyk / And the sonne was seke and cam to his last ende & deyd And the fader leyde the corps of the chylde to fore the aulter of saynt domynyk & began to wepe and saye / Blessyd domynyk I cam to the alle glad and Ioyeful but alas I goo home soroufully / I cam with my sonne but I retorne without hym / Yelde to me ageyn my sone / Gyue to me agayn the gladnesse of my herte / ¶ And aboute mydnyght the childe reuyued & wente aboute in the chyrche / There was a yong man which was serf and bonde to a yonge lady / and wente to fysshe in a water / and be fylle therin and was drowned / and he was a longe whyle in the water / & was drawē out al deed And the lady prayd saynt domynyk for the reysyng of hym / and promised that she wold goo barefoot vnto his relikes / and yf he were reysed she wold make hym a frere / and quyte hym hys bondage / and he aroos vp tofore them al / and she acomplisshyd her auowe ¶ In that same prouynce of hongrye There was a man that wepte by cause that his sone was deed & preyd saynt domynyk for his reysyng to lyf / and aboute the cock crownyng / the dede body aroos and openyd his eyen sayeng to his fader / Whefore fader haue ye your face so weet / ¶ And he sayd sone they be the teres of thy fader / ¶ For thou were deed / And I remayned allone and sorouful / ¶ And he sayd fader ye wepte moche / but seynt domynyk had pyte of your wepyng / and gate by his merytes to rendre me to you all hool / A seek man there was whyche had ben xviij yere blynde / and desired to vysite the reliques of seint domynyk as prouyng and assayeng aroos out of his bedde / And anone he felte so grete vertue in hym self that he began hastely to goo / and the more he wente / the more he was strenger to goo and the more clerlyer he sawe / and whan he cam / he receyued perfyght helthe / In that prouynce a lady ordeyned to doo synge a masse in thonour of seynt domynyk / and she fonde not the preest atte hour due / And she wrappyd thre candellys that she had made redy in a toweyll / and leyde them in a vessell / And thenne she torned her a lytyl & after cam agayn and fond her candelles enlumyned and brennyng appertly and eche body ran for to see thys grete meruaylle / and abode there so longe tyl the candellys were brent without enpeyryng of the towayll / There was a scoler at boloyne whiche was named Nycholas whyche suffred grete payne in his raynes and in his knees / so that he had none hope of helthe / & auowed to seynt domynyk and toke a threde to make a candel of his lengthe / and mesured hym in lengthe and brede / And whan the threde atteyned to his knees he called at euery mesure the name of Ih̄u cryst and of seynt domynyk anon he felte allegeaūce / and sayde I am delyuerd and aroos vp and wepte for ioye / and cam to the chyrche wythout ony ayde / where the body of seynt Domynyk restyd / and god shewed for hym myracles wythout nombre in that cyte / In Auguste the cite of cecylle was a mayde whyche was seek of the stone / and shold haue ben cutte / and for this paryll her moder commaunded her to seynt domynyk / and the nyghte folowyng seynt domynyk cam to the mayde slepyng / and leyde in her hande the stone with whiche she had ben tormented / And thenne she awoke / and fonde her self delyuerd of the payne / and delyuerd to her moder the stone / And tolde her vysyon by ordre / And the moder bare the stone to the freres / And they henge it tofore thymage in mynde and remembraunce of this fayr myracle that seynt domynyk had doon In palacye in scicile there was a poure woman that had a sone whyche was gretely tormented with scrophules / whiche chyldren ben wonte to haue in theyr necke / and coude fynd no remedy she auowed to god & to seynt domynyk that yf he myght be deliuerd / she wolde make hym to laboure in the werkes of the chyrche of freres for no hyre but gladly for nought / and the nyght folowyng / a man appiered to hyr in thabyte of a frere / & sayd woman knowest thou thyes thynges / and named to her iiij thynges / that was Arayn ve and she sayd she knewe them well and he sayde goo & take thyse thynges & confyte them with the Iuse of porret and leye on the sore of the necke of thy sonne / and he shal be al hool / Thenne she awoke and dyd so and he was all hool / and the moder accomplisshed her vowe / There was a man of piemōnt swollen lyke a monstre / auowed hym to seynt domynyk / and he apperid to hym in his slepe / and opened his bely without payne and toke out alle thordures and enoynted hym wyth hys holy honde and heled hym parfyghtly In the cite of August whan in the retorned homward to theyr houses / they sawe without a woman that spynned in the feste of one so grete a saynt / and they toke and repreued her charitably why she spanne at the feste of one so grete a seynt / and she was angry and ansuerd / ye that be wymmen of the freres / kepe ye theyr festes / and anon the eyen of that woman swellyd and there cam out roten mater and ther yssued wormes so that one of the neyghbours toke xvij wormes out of her eyen / And thenne she repented her and cam to the chyrche of the freres & confessyd her synnes / And auowed that fro than forthon she wold neuer myssaye to the seruaunt of god domynyk / but shold deuoutly holde his feste / & anon she was made hool / here was a Nonne named marye whiche was seke at Crypolyn in the monastery of Marie magdaleyn / and was smyton in the thye so greuously that fyue monethes duryng they doubted that she wold haue deyed / and thenne she bethoughte her / and prayed thus in her self / lord god I am not worthy to praye to thene to be herde of the / but I praye my lord seynt domynyk / that he be medyatour bytwene the and me that he may gete to me the benefeite of helthe / And whan she had long prayed in teres / she slepte and sawe seynt domynyk With two freres that opened the curtayn that henge afore her bedde / and entryd and sayde to her / Wherfor desirest thou so sore to be heled / And she sayd syr that I myght more deuoutly serue god / And thenne he drewe out his oynement whiche was of swete odour from vnder hys cope / and enoynted her thye / and she was anon alle hool / and sayd thys oynement is moche precious swete and lyght / And whan she demaunded how it was named he sayd to her / thys oynement is the oynement of loue / & is so precious that it may not be bought for no prys / For in the yeftes of god is no better than loue / For there is nothyng more precyous than charyte / but it is sone lost yf it be not well kept / Thenne he appered to her suster that nyght that slepte in y e dortour sayeng / I haue heled thy suster whiche anon aroos & ranne thyder and fonde her hool / And Whan she felte her enoynted with sensible vnction / she wyped it with grete reuerence with a bendel of sylke / And whan she had tolde alle this to the abbesse / to her suster and to her confessour / and had shewed the vnction and bendel they were smyten with the nouelte of the sauour so suete smellyng that it myght not be compared to none Aromatyke / and they kepte that vnction with grete reuerence / how agreable the place is vnto god where the body of seynt Domynyk

grete tempest of thondre and lightnyng descended from heuen vpon hym / & thenne he fled the tempest / and cam tofore an hows and fond it shette / and knocked atte dore for to entre in / and thostesse answerd / I am rightwysnes that am enhabyted here / and this hous is myne and thou art not rightwys / Therfore thou mayst not enhabyte here / And thenne he wepte bytterly for thyse wordes / and went to a nother hous that he sawe beyonde that and knocked at the dore for to come in / but thostesse whyche was within answerd / I am trouthe / and thou art not trewe ther for I may not receyue the / And fro thens he went to the iij hous beyonde that / and requyred that he myght come in for the tempest / and he that was wythin sayde / I am peas that duelle here / and peas is not with felons / but only

harme ne be greuous to me / ne that I goo out of my hous / O donat wherfor constraynest thou me to yssue out with tormentes / but he was anon delyuerd whan donat prayed / There was a man named Eustace whiche receyued in Tuskane the rentes of the prynce / and lefte the money in the kepyng of his wyf named Eufronye / But for sorowe that she had of the enemyes that destroyed the contree / she hyd the money and deyed for sorowe / and whan her husbond cam agayn he coude not fynde the money / and whan he with his children shold be brought to tormente / He fledde to Seynt donat / and donat went with hym to the sepulcre of his Wyf / & sayd with a clere voys / Eufronye I coniure the by y e vertu of the holy ghoost that thou say where thou hast leyde this moneye / And she answerd out of the sepulture and sayd / At the entree of the hows where I dalue it / And thenne they went thyder and fonde it like as she had sayd / & a lytil whyle after Satirus the bysshop deyed in our lord / and alle the clergy choos donat to be bysshop in his place / and so he was / On a day as seynt gregore recounteth in his dyalogue whan Seynt donate houseled the peple after masse and the deken mynystred the body of our lord to the peple / sodanly the deken fyll wyth the chalyce by thympulsion and threstyng of the paynems that cam thyder / and the chalyse brake / wherof he was sory and so was alle the peple / And seynt donat gadred to gydre the pieces of the chalice and made his prayer / and remysed it in his first forme / and a lytil pyece the deuyll toke awaye and hydde it / which piece lacketh yet in the chalyce / and that chalice is kepte in the sayd chyrche in Wytnes of thys myracle / And the paynyms that sawe thys Were conuerted to the fayth in so moche that lxxx of them receyued bapteme / There was a welle or a fontayne enfected that who that dranke if it was anon deed And seynt donat went anon thyder vpon his asse for to praye and make the water hool / and anon an horryble dragon yssued out of the fontayn / and wonde his tayle aboute the legges of the asse / and adressyd hym ayenst donate / and donate smote hym wyth his staffe / or as somme say he spytte in hys mouth and he deyed / and thenne he prayed to our lord & chased awaye alle the venym out of the fontayne / Another tyme whan he & his felawes had grete thruste / he made a fontayn to sourde tofore them / The doughter of themperour / theodocien Was tormented with a deuyl / and was brought to Seynt donat / and he sayd / thou foule spirite goo out and dwelle nomore in this creature whyche is the forme of god / To whom the deuyl sayd gyue me place where I shal yssue out and telle to me whyther I shal goo / Seynt donat sayde to hym / Fro whens camst thou hyther / and he sayd fro deserte And donat answerd retorne thou thyder / and the deuyll sayd / I see in the the signe of the crosse out of which the fyre spryngeth ayenst me / / & for drede of the fyre I doubte for to goo / gyue me place and I shal yssue out / And donat sayde loo here is place that thou mayst goo thy waye / and retorne thyder that thou camest fro / And thenne he made alle the hous to tremble / and Went his waye / There was a man borne to be buryed / & there cam a man that brought an oblygacion and sayd that he ought to hym two hondred shylynges / and therfor he wold not suffre hym to be buryed in no wyse / wherfore his wyf whyche was wydowe cam to seynt donat and shewed to hym that mater / and sayd that thylke man had receyued al that moneye / thenne went seint donat to the corps and touched the dede man wyth his honde / and sayde / arise thou vp / and see what thou shalt doo to this man that suffreth not to burye the / the Whiche thenne satte vp and preued that he had payd it & vaynquysshed hym tofore all men and toke thoblygacion in hys honde and rente it in pieces / and after sayd to seynt donate / Fader cōmaunde me to slepe agayn And he sayd sone goo now in to reste forthon / And in that tyme it had not reyned wel in thre yere / and that the erthe had be bareyn and brought forth no fruyt / the mescreantes cam to themperour Theodocien requyryng that he shold delyuer to them donat which had made that by his art magyke / But at the requeste of themperour / donat cam and prayed our lord that he wold sende to them reyne / And he sente to them so grete haboūdance that al the other were wette / and he went home allone / In that tyme that the gothes destroyed ytalye / and that moche peple departed from the fayth of god / Euadryan the prouost was repreued of Apostasye / & seynt donat and seynt hillary repreued hym / and thenne he toke them / & Wolde haue constrayned them to doo sacrefise to Iubyter / But they reffused it / & he dyd do bete hillarye so moche alle despoyled that he gaf vp his spyryte to god / and he leyde donat in pryson / and after dyd do smyte of his hede the yere of our lord CCClxxx / • Seynt donate / the wyckyd spirite began to crye Thus endeth the lyf of seynt Donat martir Here begynneth the lyf of seint Ciriake martir / CIriake was ordeyned deken of Marcelle the pope / and was taken and brought to maximien themperour / and was commaunded that he and his felawes shold deluethe erthe / and shold bere it on theyre sholdres vnto the place that he made / And there was seynt saturnyne whom Ciriake and sisinnius heelpe for to bere And after Ciriake was put and enclosed in pryson / and atte last was presented tofore the prouoste / And as Appropynyan ladde hym sodanly cam a voys with light fro heuen Which sayd Come ye blessyd of my fader & c̄ And thenne Appropinianus byleued & made hym self to be baptysed / And cam to the prouost confessyng Ihesu cryste / To whom the prouost sayde / Art not thou made crysten / Whiche answerde / Alas for I haue lost my dayes / The prouost answerd truly now thou lesest thy dayes / and commaunded to smyte of hys hede / And whan saturnyn / and sisinnius wold not make sacrefyse / They were tormented with dyuerse tormentes / and atte last were byheded / And the doughter of dyoclesyan named Arthemie was tormented of the deuyl / & the deuyl cryed within her and sayde / I shalle not goo out tofore that Ciria and thenne sayde the deuyll / yf thou wylt that I yssue and goo out / gyue me a vessel where I may entre in / and thenne answerd Ciriake / lo here is my body entre therin yf thou mayst / and he sayd In to thy vessell I may not entre / For it is signed and closed on alle sydes / but yf thou caste me out here / I shalle make the soon come in to babilone / and whan he was constreyned to goo out arthennya cryed and sayd / I see the god that Ciriak prechith / and whan he had buptysed her / and had grace of dyoclesian and of Serene his Wyf / he dwellyd and lyued surely in an hous that he gaf hym / Thenne cam there a message fro the kyng of perse to dioclesian prayeng hym that he wold sende hym Ciriake / For his doughter was tormented of a deuyll / and thenne by the prayers of dyoclesyan Ciriake went gladly wyth largo & smaragdo wyth alle thynges necessaryy in the shyppe in to babylone / and whan they cam to the doughter / the deuyll cryed to hym thorugh the mouthe of the mayden / O Ciriak thou art wery of traueyll and he sayd I am not wery / but am gouerned oueral by the helpe of god / And the deuyll said / neuertheles I haue brought the there as I wold haue the And Ciriak sayd / Ihesu cryst commandeth the that thou goo out / And thenne the deuyll yssued out & sayde O name terryble that constrayneth me And the mayde was thenne made hole And was baptysed wyth fader & moder and moche other peple / And they offred to hym many yeftes but he wold none take / and abode there xlv dayes fastyng in brede and water / and atte laste he cam to rome / And after ij monethes dyoclesyan was deed / And Maximyen succeded to thempyre / And was wroth wyth Arthemye his suster / and toke Ciriake and bonde hym wyth chaynes / and commaunded to drawe hym tofore his chare / This maxymyen may be called & sayd the sone of dyoclesyan by cause he succeded hym / and had his doughter to wyf whyche was called valeriane / and after he commaunded to carpase his vicaire to constrayne Ciriake and hys felawes to doo sacrefyse / or ellys slee them by dyuerse tormentis / And he toke Ciriaque / and threwe pytche molten and brennyng hote on his hede / & henge hym in the tormente named eculee / and after he dyd do smyte of the hede of Ciriake / and also byheded hys felaws about the yere of our lord iijC And Carpase gate the hous of Seynt Ciriake / and in despyte of crysten men he made a bayne in the same place where Ciriak baptysed / and there bayned and made bankettis in etyng and drynkyng / And sodenly he wyth xix felawys deyed there / And therfore the bayne was closed vp / And the paynems began to drede and honour crysten men / •k the dekene come / and thenne was Ciriaque brought to her / Thus endeth the lyf of Seynt Ciriake / Here foloweth the lyf of saynt laurence and first of his name LAurence is said as holdyng a crowne made of laurier / For sōtyme they that vaynquysshyd in bataylle were crowned wyth laurier bowes and braunches shewyng vyctorye / and it is alleway couerable verdour / of odour agreable & vertuous of strengthe / and the blessyd laurence is sayd of laurier / for he had victorye in his passyon / wherof decius confused sayd / I wene now that we be vaynquysshed / he had verdeur in clennesse of herte and purete / For he sayd my voys hath no derkenes / he had odour of perpetuel memoire / wherof it is sayd he departed alle and gaf to pour peple / and therfor remayneth his droyture perdurably / whyche he fulfilled wyth holy werke / and halowed it by hys gloryous martirdom / he had strengthe by his vertuous prechyng by whiche he conuerted lucille the prouost romayn / This is that tree of suche vertu / that the leef brake the stone / heled the deef / and doubted no thoucer / ¶ And thus laurence brake the hard herde / he gaf spyrituel reward / And deffended the sentence for the thonder of euyl peple Of saynt laurence the glorious martyr LAurence martir and subdeken was of the lignage of spayne and saynt sixte brouʒt hym thens / And as maister Iohan beleth sayth / whan the blessed sixte Went in to spayne / he fonde there ij yongmen laurence and vyncent his cosyn right ordynat by honeste of maners and noble in all theyr werkes / and brought them with hym to rome / Of whom that one that was laurence abode with hym / And vincent his cosyn retorned in to spayne and there fynysshyd his lyf by glorious martirdom / But in this reson maister beleth repugneth the tyme of martyrdom of that one and of that other / For it is said that laurence suffred deth vnder decian and vincēt vnder dyoclesyan / and bytwene decian and dyoclesyan were aboute xl yere And ther were vij emperours bytwene them So that the blessyd vyncent myght not be yong / & the blessyd sixte ordeyned laurence his archedeken / and in his tyme Phylip themperour And phylyp his sone receyued the fayth of Ihesu cryste / And whan they were crystend they entendyd gretely to enhaūce the chyrche / And this emperour was the first that receyueyd the fayth of ihū cryst / whom as it is said Origenes cōuerted to the fayth / How had don it And he regned the yere a thousād fro the byldyng of rome So that the yere a thousand shold rather be yeuē to crist than to thydolles / And that yere was halowed of the romaynes with right grete appareylle of games & grete esbatemens / And there was a knyght with philip themperour named decian Which was noble & moche renomed in armes and in batayles / And whan in that tyme fraūce rebelled ayenst this emperour / He sente thyder decien for to take awey the cōtenciōs & subdue them torome / & decius so sent thider made all thynges wel / And subdued them all to rome / And had vyctorye / And whan themperour herd hys comyng / And wold honoure hym more hyely And wente ayenst hym vnto verone But for as moche as the euyl peple fele them more honoured / so moche more he was swollen in pryde / Thenne decien elate in pride begāne to coueyte thempyre / And on a tyme whan decien knewe that themperour slepte in his pauyllon / he entred in secretely and cut the throte of his lord slepyng And thēne he drewe to hym by yeftes and prayers & also by promesses all them of the hoost that themperour had brought / And wente anone to the cyte of rome / And whan philyp the yōger herd this thyng / he was sore aferd and doubted strōgly / And as Sica delyured all his faders tresour & his to to saynt sixte and to saynt laurence / to thende / that if hit happed hym to be slayn of decyen / that they shold gyue this tresoure to poure peple / and to the Chirches / And wondre not that the tresours that laurence gaf / be not named the tresours of themperour / but of the chirche / or parauenture they were sayd tresours of the chirche / For Phelyp had lefte them to be dispendyd to the chirche / And after phelip fledde and hydde hym for fere of decyen / And thenne the senate went ayenst decian / and confermed hym in thempyre / And by cause he was not scene to haue slayne his lord by treson but only for he had renyed thydollys / therfor he beganne right cruelly to persecute the chirche and Cristen men / and commaunded that they shold be destroyed withoute mercy / And many thousand martirs were slayne among whome phelyp was crowned with martirdom / And after that decius / made a serche of the tresours of his lord / Thenne was Sixte brought to hym as he that adoured Ihesu Crist / and had the tresours of thempyre / And thenne commaunded decian / that he shold be putte in pryson so long that by tormentys he shold renye god / and telle where the tresours were / And the blessid laurence folowed hym / and cryed after hym / whyther goost thou fader withoute a mynyster / what thyng is in / me y t hath displesyd thy faderhode / or what thyng hast y u sene in me hast y u seen me / forsake my lygnage or go out of kynde / Proue me whether thou hast chosen a couenable mynystre / to whome thou hast commysed the dispensacion of the body and blood of oure lord / To whome seynt Sixte sayd / I shalle not leue the my sone / but gretter stryues and bataylles be due to the for the feyth of Ihesu crist we as old men haue taken more lightter bataylle / & to the as to a yong man shall remayne a more gloryouse batayll of whiche thou shalt tryumphe & haue vyctorye of the tyraunt / and shalt folowe me within thre dayes / Thenne he delyuerd to hym alle the tresours comandyng hym that he shold gyue them to chirches and poure peple / And the blessyd man sought the poure peple nyght and day / And gaf to eche of them that as was nedefull / and cam to the hows of an old woman / whiche had hydde in her hows many crysten men & wymmen / And long she had had the hede ache / And saynt Laurence leyd his hād vppon her hede / And anon she was heled of the ache & peyne / And he wesshe the feete of the poure peple / And gafe to eche of them almesse / The same nyʒt he wente to the hows of a crysten man and fonde therin a blynd man / and gafe to hym his sight by the signe of the crosse / And whan the blessid / Sixt wolde not consente to decian / ne offre to thydollys / he commaunded / that he sholde be ledde forth / and be byheded And the blessid laurence ran after hym and seid / Forsake me not holy fader / For I haue dispended the tresours that thou delyuerst to me / And whan the knyghtes herd speke of the tresours / they took laurence / and brought hym to the prouost / And the prouost delyuerd hym to decian / And Decian Cesar said to hym / where ben the tresours of the chirche / whiche we knowe well that thou hast hyd / & he answerd not / wherfor he delyuerd hym to Valeryan the prouoste to thende that he shold shewe the tresours / and doo sacrifise to thydolles / or to putte hym to deth by dyuerse tormentis / And Valeryen delyuerd hym to a prouost named Ypolyte for to be in pryson / and he enclosed hym in pryson with many other / And ther was in pryson a paynym named Lucylle / which had lost the sight of his eyen with ouermoche wepyng / And seynt laurence promysed to hym to rystablysshe his sight / yf he wold byleue in Ihesu Crist and receyue baptym / And he requyred anone to be baptysed / Thenne seynt laurence took water and said to hym / Alle thynges in confession ben wasshen / And whan he had dylygently enformed hym in the artycles of the feythe / And he confessid that he byleuyd alle / he shadde water on his hede / and baptysed hym in the name of Ihesu Crist / And anon he that had be blynde / receyued his sight ayene And therfor cam to hym many blynd men / and wente ageyne enlumyned from hym / and hauyng their sight / And thenne agayne Ypolyte saide to hym shewe to me the tresours / to whom laurence sayd / Ypolyte / yf thou Wylt byleue in oure lord Ihesu Crist / I shal shewe to the / the tresours / and promyse to the lyf perdurable / And Ypolyte sayd / yf thou doo this that thou sayst / I shalle doo that thou requyrest / And in that same houre Ypolyte byleuyd / and receyued the holy baptym / he & all his meyne / And whan he was beptysed / he sayd / I haue sene the sowles of the Innocentes Ioyous and glad / And after this Valeryan sente to ypo lyte that he shold brynge hym laurence / and laurence said to hym late vs goo to gyder / For the glory is made redy to me and to the / And thenne they cam to Iugement / And he was enquyred agayne of the tresours / And laurence demaunded dylacion of thre dayes / and Valeryen graunted hym on pledge of Ypolyte / And sayn gadred to geder poure peple blynde and lame / and presented them tofore decian / in the palays of Salustyen and sayd / These here ben the tresours perdurable / whiche shalle not be mynuysshed / but encrece / whiche be departed to eche of them The handes of thise men haue borne the tresours in to heuen / Thenne Valeryan in the presence af decian said / what varyest thow in many thynges / Sacrefye anone / and put fro the thyne arte magyke / And laurence sayd to hym / whether ought he to be adoured / that maketh / or he that is made And thenne decian was angry / and commanded that he shold be beten with scorpyons / And that alle maner of tormentes shold be brought to fore hym / And thenne commaunded he hym / that he shold doo sacrefyse for teschewe these tormentes / and saynt laurence answerd Thou cursyd man / I haue alwey coueyted these metes / To whome decius said yf these be metes for the / shewe to me them / that be lyke to the / that they may ete with the / To whome laurence said / they haue gyuen their names in to heuen / and thou art not worthy to see them / And thenne by the commaundement of decien / he was beten al naked with roddes and staues and pyeces of yron brennyng were leyd to his sydes And laurence said / lord Ihesu Criste / god / sone of god / haue mercy on me thy seruaunt / whiche am acused / renyed the / and they haue demaunded me / and I haue confessyd the to be my lord / And thenne Decius sayd to hym / I knowe wel / that thou despysest the tormentes / by thyn art magyke / but me thou mayste not despyse / I swere by my goddes and goddesses that but thou wylt do sacryfice to them thou shalt be punysshed by dyuerse tormentes / Thenne he commaunded / that he shold be long beten with pl And thenne he prayd sayeng lord Ihesu crist receyue my spyryte / And thenne cam a voys from heuen / decian heryng whiche sayd yet many tormentes ben due to the / And thenne decian sayd replenysshyd with felonye / ye men of Rome / haue ye herde the deuylles cōfortyng / this cursyd man whiche adoured not the goddes / ne doubted not the tormentes / ne dredeth not the prynces wrathe / And thenne commaunded he ageyne that he shold be beten with scorpyons / And thenne laurence smylyng rendryd thankynges to god / and prayd for them / that were there / And in that same houre a knyght named R byleuyd in god / and said to saynt laurence / I see to fore the a right faire yonglyng stondyng / and with a lynnen clothe clensyng thy woundes I adiure the by the lyuyng lord god that thou leue not / but haste the to baptyse me / And thenne said decien to valeryen / I wene that we shalle now be ouercomen by arte magyke / And thenne he commaunded / that he / sholde be vnbounden / and enclosed in the pryson of ypolyte / And thenne Romayne brouʒt an vrcelle or a cruse with water / and fylle doune atte feet of saynt laurence / And receyued baptysme of hym / And when decyan knewe it / he commāded that Romayn shold be beten with roddes / And he was so moche beten / that he myght not holde hym vpon his legges / but in no maner myght no mā make hym say / but that he was a good Cristen / and frely baptysed / And thenne decyan dyd do smyte of his hede / And that nyghte was laurence led to decyen / And when Ypolyte which was there sawe that / he began to wepe / and wolde haue sayd / that he was cristened And Laurence said to hym / hyde Ihesu Crist within the / And whan I shalle crye / here and come thyder / And thenne alle maner of tormentes / that couthe be deuysed or thought / were brought tofore decian / And thēne said decian to laurence / or thou shalt make sacrifyse to the goddes / or this nyght shalle alle these tormentes be dispendyd on the / And thenne laurence said to hym / my nyght hath no derkenes / but alle thynges shyne in my syghte / And thenne sayd decian / brynge hyder a bedde of yron / that laurence contymax may lye theron / And the mynystres despoylled hym / And leyd hym stratched oute vppon a gredyron of Yron / and leyd brennyng coles vnder / and helde hym with forkes of yron / Thenne said laurence to Valeryan / lerne thou cursyd wretche / for thy coles gyue to me refresshyng of coldnes / and make redy to the torment perdurable / And oure lord knoweth / that I beyng accused haue not forsaken hym / And whan I was demaunded I confessid hym criste / And I beyng rosted yeue thankynges vn god & after this he said witha glad there vnto decian / thou cursyd wretche thou haste rosted that one syde / tourne that other / and ete / And thenne he rendryng thankynges to oure lord sayd I thanke the lord Ihesu Criste / For I haue deserued to entre in to thy yates / And so gaf vp his spyryte / And thenne decian beyng all confused walked in to the palais of Tiberye with Valeryan / and lefte the body lyeng vppon the fyre which ypolyte in the mornyng toke away / with Iustyne the preeste / And beryed it with precious oynementes in the felde Verane / And the Crysten men that buryed hym / fasted thre dayes and thre nyghtes / and halowed the Vygyles wepyng there and waylyng / But many doubte yf he suffred deth vnder this decian / For it is red in the Cronycle / that Sixte was long after decian / Eutropius neuertheles affermeth and sayth / that decian meuynge persecucyon ageynst crysten men among other / he slewe the blessid laurence dekē and martir / And it is said in a Cronyke autentyke ynough / that it was not vnder this decyan emperour / that succeded to phelyp / but vnder another decyan yonger / whiche was Cezar and not emperour / he suffred martirdome / For bytwene Decyan themperour / and this decyan the yonger vnder whome it is said that laurence was martryd / ther were many emperours and popes Also it is said that gallus and Volusianus his sone succeded decyan / And after them Valeryen with galren his sone helde thempyre / And they made decyan the yonger Cezar and not emperour / For auncyently whan ony was made Cezar / neuerthemore he was Augustus ne emperour / as it is redde in the cronycles / that Dyoclesyan made maxymyan Cezar / And after fro Cezar he was made Augustus and emperour / ¶ In the tyme of these emperours valeryen and galyan Sixt helde the see of Rome / And this Decyan was called Cezar and not emperour / but decyan Cezar only / And he martred the blessid Fabyan / And cornely succeded after Fabyan / whiche was martred vnder Valeryan and galyan / whiche regned xv yere / And lucyan succeded Cornely / And Stephen the pope succeded lucyan / And Denys succeded Stephen / And Sixte succeded Denys / And this is conteyned in that Cronycle / And yf this be trewe / that whiche mayster Iohan beleth putteth / maye be trewe And it is redde in an other cronycle that the said galyan had two names / and was called galyan / and Decyan / and vnder hym Sixte & Laurence suffred martirdom about the yere of oure lord twoo honderd / and thre score / Godefroy in his booke / that is called antheonydes / affermeth / that galyan was called by another name Decyan / Seynt gregory sayth in hys Dyaloges / that ther was a nonne in Sabyne / whiche held hyr contynent of her flesshe / but she eschewed not the Ianglerye of her tonge / and she was buryed in the chirch of saynt laurence the holy martir / And was leyd to fore the aulter of the martir / and was taken of the deuyls and departed and so wen a sondre / and that one parte was brente / and that other parte remayned hoole / so that on the mornyng the brennyng appered vysybly / Gregory of Tours sayth / that whan a certeyne preest repayred the chirch of saynt laurence / And one of the bemes was ouer short / and requyred saynt laurence / that he whiche had norysshed poure men wold helpe his pouerte / And the beme grew so sodenly that ther remayned a grete parte / And the preest cut that part in to smal pyeces and cured and heled ther with many maledyes / And this wytnesseth seynt fortunate / It happed at Bryoras a castell in ytaly / that a man was sore vexed with tooth ache / And he atouched this wode And anone the ache was gone / Seynt gregory telleth in his book of dyaloges that a preest named sanctyne repayred a chirche of saynt laurence whiche had be brente of lumbardes / and hyred many werkmen / And one tyme he had nothyng to sette to fore them / And thenne he made his prayers / and after loked in his paner / and there he fonde a moch whyte loof of breed / but hym semed / that hit suffysed not for one dyner for thre persones / Seynt Laurence / whiche wolde not fayle his werkmen / dyd doo multyplye that his werkmen were susteyned therby ten dayes / ¶In the chirch of saynt laurence at melan was a chalyce of crystall / merueylously clere And as the deken bare it on a day of solempnyte / to the aulter / it fylle oute of his hondes to the ground / and was all to broken / And thenne the deken wepyng gadered to gyder the pyeces / And leyd them on the aulter / And prayd the holy martir seynt laurence / that the chalyce broken myght be made hoole ageyne / And thenne anone it was founden al hool It is redde inthe book of the myracles of oure blessid lady saynt Marye / that a Iuge named Stephen was at rome / and tooke gladly yeftes / and peruerted the Iugemētes / And this Iuge tooke aweye by force thre howses / that were longyng to the chirche of saynt laurence / And a gardyn of saynt Agnes / And posseded them wrongfully / It happed that the Iuge deyed / and was brouʒt to Iugement to fore god / And whan saynt laurence sawe hym / he wente to hym in grete despyte / And strayned hym thre tymes by the arme right hard And tormented hym by grete payne / And saynt Agnes & other Vyrgyns dayned not to loke on hym / but torned their vysages awey fro hym / And thēne the Iuge gyuyng sentence ageynst hym said / by cause he hath withdrawen other mennes thynges / and hath taken yeftes and solde trouthe / that he shold be put in the place of Iudas the traytour / And saynt Proiecte whome the sayd Stephen had moche louyd in his lif cam to the blessid laurence and to saynt Agnes and cryed them mercy for hym / Thenne the blessid vyrgyn Mary and they prayd to god for hym / And thenne it was graunted to them that the sowle of hym sholde goo ageyn to the body / and there sholde do his penaunce thyrty dayes / And oure blessid lady commaunded hym / that as longe as he lyued / he sholde say the psalme / Beati inmaculati / And when the soule cam to the body ageyn / his arme was lyke as it had be brent / lyke as he had suffred that hurte in his body / And that token and signe was in hym as longe as he lyued / Thenne rendryd and dyde And atte xxx day / he passed oute of this world to oure lord / It is redde in the lyf of saynt Henry themperour / that he and kunegonde his wyf were vyrgyns to geder / by thatysement of the deuyll / he had his wyf suspecte of a knyghte / And he made his wyf goo barfoote vppon brennyng asshes / fyften paas / And whan she ascēded vppon them she said thus / As I am not corrupte ne defowled of Harry ne of al other / so Ihesu criste helpe me / Thenne Henry themperour was ashamed / and yafe her a buffet on the c deed there wente a grete multitude of deuyls to fore the celle of an heremyte / and he opened the wyndowe and demaunded atte last what they were / and one answerde a legyon of deuyls we be / that goo to the deth of themperour / yf parauenture we may fynde ony thyng in hym / He adiured hym / that he sholde come ageyne to hym / whiche retornyng sayde / we haue prouffyted no thyng / For whan this fals suspecion of hys wyf / and alle the good thynges and euylle thynges were leyd in a balaūce / this brente and bruled / laurence brought forthe a pot of gold of moche grete weyght / And whan we supposed to haue surmounted / he caste that pot in the balaunce on that other syde / so that it weyeth more and was heuyer / And thenne I was angry / and brak an ere of the pot / And he called that pot a chalyce / whiche themperour hadde gyuen to the chirche Emstence / whiche he had in speciall deuocion / And had do made it in thonoure of saynt laurence / And for the gretenes of it / hit had two eres / ¶ And it was founden thenne that emperour deyde that tyme / and one ere was broken of the Chalyce / •e it that it is redde in other place other wyse / And that saynt po•cian • sayth in his cronyke he • laurence in these thre dayes 〈◊〉 I haue not •mmettys / ••mayne •o 〈◊〉 that whiche he had taken 〈◊〉 penaunce / ••ke / and a voys said the Vyrgyn Mary hath delyuerd the Vyrgyn / and she wēt without ony hurt vppon the brennyng asshes & when thēperour was Gregory reherceth in his Regystre / that his predecessour coueyted to make better somme thynges aboute the body of saynt laurence / but he wyste not where it lay / netheles the body of saynt laurence was discouerd / and vnheled by ygnoraunce / but alle they / that were there present as wel monkes as other were deed in fyften dayes after / It is to wete that the passyon of saynt laurence was moost excellent in foure thynges / lyke as it is founden by the sayenges of saynt Maxymyn bisshop / and of saynt Austyn / Fyrst in the sournes of his passion or bytternes Secondly in prouffyte or effect / Thyrdly in constaunce / or strengthe / And fourthly in the merueylous bataylle and maner of his vyctorye / Fyrst it was right excellent in the bytternes of the peyne / this sayth saynt Maxymyn / And after somme bookes of saynt Ambrose / Bretheren saynt laurence was not slayn by short and symple passion / For who that is smyten with a swerd he deyeth but ones / And who that is caste in a fyre is delyuerd at ones / but this hooly man was tormented by longe and multyplyed paynes / so that the dethe shold not fayle hym at tormente / ne fayle hym at the ende / ¶ we rede that the blessid chyldren wente thorugh the flambes / And haue gone vpon the coles brennyng harfeet wherof saynt laurence is not to be preferred of lasse glorye / For as they wente in theyr paynes thorugh the flāmes / This in his torment laye vppon the fyre / They defowled / and trade vpon the fire with their feete / And this was restreyned for to leye his sydes therin / They praide in their paynes holdynge vp their handes to oure lord god / but he was stratched in his payne and prayd oure lord with alle his body / And it is to wete that the blessid laurence is he / that after saynt Stephen ought to holde the prymacye / Not only for that he suffred gretter payne / than other martyrs / as is wel founde and redde / that many haue suffred as moche payne / but it is sayd for sixe causes Fyrste for the place of the passion / For hit was at Rome / whiche is heed of the world / and Syege of the Apostles / Secondly / for thoffyce of the predycacion / For he accomplysshed dylygently thoffyce of prechyng / Thyrdely for the lowable dystrybucion of the tresours / that he gaf alle to poure men wysely / And these thre Reasons putteth Maister Wylliam of Ancerre / Fourthly for the antyquyte / and proued martirdome / For yf it be sayd / that somme other haue had / gretter payne / Alwey hit is not so Autentyke / And also somtyme in doubte / but the passion of saynt laurence is moche solempne / and approued in the Chirche / ¶ And therfore many Sayntes approuue his passion in theyr Sermons and afferme hit / Fyftly for the degree of dignyte / For he was Archedeken of the Syege of Rome / And as it is sayd / ther was neuer sythe Archedeken in Rome / ¶ Sixtely / for the cruelte of tormentes / For he suffred them right greuous / as he / that was rosted vppon a gredyron of yron / ¶ Wherof saynt Austxn sayth / Sythe / that the membres were broken by many dyuerse betynges / He was commaunded to be tormented vppon a gredyl of yron / and was leide therupon whiche by contynuell heete / that was ther vnder / the gredyll hadde tho force to brenne / soo that he was tormented by the tornynge of his membrys more forcybly / For the payne was the more long / Secondly he was right eycellent in effecte or prouffyte / For after this / that Austyn and Maxymyn saye / this bytternes of payne made hym hyghe by gloryfycacion / and honourable by opynyon / renomed and lowable by deuocion and noble by contencion / Fyrst it made hym hyhe by gloryficacion / wherof saynt Austyn sayth / Persecutour / thou we rewood ayenst the martir / & more than wood / For whan thou assemblest peyne / thou encreacest his glorye / thyn engyn fonde not glorye of the ayde whan thynstrumentes of the tormentes transported hym in thonoure of vyctorye / And after Maxymyn & in somme bokes of Ambrose it is sayd / how be hit that the membres were bounden in the hete of the sparcles / the force of the feith was not corrupt / the body suffred enpayryng / but he gate the gayne of helthe / And saynt Austyn sayth truly his body is blessid / For torment neuer chaunged hym out of the feyth of god but his relygyon crowned hym in holy reste / Secondly he was honourable by oppynyon and renommee after maxymyn and Ambrose / that saye / we may lykene the blessid laurence to mustard seed / whiche is broken by many maners / whan by the grace of his mystery he replenysshed the world of good odoure / For to fore that he was constytute in his body / he was humble vnknowen and seruysable / And after that he was all to broken and brente / he shedde in all the chirches of the world the odour of his noblesse / ¶ Also this is an hooly thynge and playsaunt / that the solempnyte of saynt laurence be nobly honoured / whoos shynyng flammes he as vaynquysshoure holy chirch haloweth this day in alle the world / in so moche that his gloryous passyon enlumyneth alle the world / by the glorye of his martyrdō / Thyrdely he was lowable by deuocion / wherfor was he so lowable and so with deuocion to be reputed / Seynt Austyn sheweth it by thre reasons / and sayth thus / We ought to receyue the blessid man with deuocion / Fyrst / for he gaf his precious blood for the loue of oure lord / And after / for by cause he had vnto oure lord grete affynyte / shewyng / that the feyth of cristen men ought to deserue to be of the company of martirs / Thyrdly / by cause he was soo / holly of conuersacion / that in the tyme of pees he deseruyd the croune of martirdom / Fourthly he made hym self noble by folowyng / wherof saynt Austyn sayth that the cause of all his passion was by cause he exhorted other to be lyke to hym / In thre thynges he shewed hym to vs folowyng / Fyrste in strong suffryng of aduersitees / wherof saynt Austyn sayth / the moost prouffitable forme for tenforme the peple to god / is the faire speche of martirs / It is lyght to praye / and it is prouffytable to admoneste and warne the thynges / And thexamples be better than the wordes / And it is more to teche by werke than by voys / And in thys right excellent maner of techyng the persecutours myght fele of laurence how he shone by grete dygnyte / And how the merueylous strengthe of hys courage gaf not only place of byleue / but also comforted and strengthed other by ensample of his suffraunce / Secondly by gretenes of the feyth and feruour of loue / Wherof Maxymyn sayth / and Ambrose also / whan he vaynquysshyd by feyth / the flammes of the persecutoure he shewde to vs by the fyre of fayth that he ouercam thembracementes of the fyre of helle / And by the loue of Crist not to fere the day of dome / Thyrdly in brennyng loue / Maxymyn and Ambrose seyn / that saynt laurence enlumyned the world playnly / of the same lyght that he was embraced with and chauffed the hertes of all crysten people / by the flammes that he suffred by these thre thynges sayth saynt Maxymyn after the bookes of saynt Ambrose that we ben called to the feythe by thexample of saynt laurence / and embraced to martirdome / and chauffed to deuocion / Thyrdly he was right excellent in constaunce and in strengthe / And herof sayth saynt Austyn / The blessid laurence dwellid in Ihesu cryste vnto the temptacion / vnto the demaunde of the tyraunt / And vnto the deth / in whome thocasion was longe / and by cause / that he had well eten and well dronken / he was fat of this mete And dronken of the chalyce / soo that he felte not the tormentes ne eschewed them / but succeded the Royamme of heuen / he was so constaunt / that he sette not by the tormentes / but after that saynt Maxymyn sayth / he was made more parfight in drede more ardaunt in loue / and more Ioyous in brennyng / For the fyrst it is sayd thus / he was stretched vpon the flammes of the grete brondes / of fyre / and torned ofte fro that one syde to that other / And how moche more he suffred of paynes / so moche more he dradde god / And of the second he sayth thus / ¶ Whan the grayne of the mostard is grounden / it chauffeth / And whan Laurence suffred tormentes / he was enflammed ageyne / and tormented of a newe maner of merueylous tormentes / And the gretter tormentes / that the wood persecutours dyden / the more deuoute was laurence to oure sauyour And as to the thyrd / he sayth thus / he was chauffed in the lawe of Ihesu Crist / that by grete hyenes of courage he despysed the tormentes of his owne body / that in hauyng Vyctorye / of his woode tormentour / he was Ioyous for to despyse it by the fyre / Fourthly he was right excellent in the merueylous bataylle / and in the maner of his vyctorye / And as it apperith openly by the wordes of saynt Maxymyn and of saynt Austyn / The blessid laurence had fyue brennynges withoute forthe / whiche he al ouercam manly / and extyncte them / ¶ The firste was the fyre of helle / The second mate ryall flamme / the thyrdde carnal concupiscence / the fourthe of brennyng couetyse / And the fyfte of a mad wodenes The quenchyng of the first fyre / that is of helle / Maxymyn sayth / It myght gyue no place of brennyng to the worldly fyre for to brenne his body / whiche quenchyd the fire perdurable of helle / he wente thurgh the fyre erthely and materyal of this world / but he escaped and eschewed them / the horryble flambe of the fire perdurable of helle / The quenchyng of the second fire he sayth also / he trauayled by bodely brennyng / but the dyuyne ardoure quenchyd the materyal brennyng / And yet sayth he / how be it the euylle peple put vnder the fagottes & woode / for tencrece / and make grete flamme / Seynt Laurence esprysed by the hete of the feyth felte not the flammes / And saynt Austyn sayth / the charyte of Ihesu Crist may not be surmounted with flammes / for the fire that brente withoute forth / was more feble / than that whiche he embracyd within forth / And the quenchyng of the thyrd fire of carnall concupyscence / sayth saynt Maxymyn / saynt laurence passed thorugh the fire / whiche he abhorryd beyng not brente / but he enlumyned shone he brenned lest he shold brenne / And by cause he shold not brenne he was brente Of the quenchynge of the fourthe fire / that is of Auaryce of them / that coueyte the tresours / of whiche they be deceyued / Sayth saynt Austyn thus / A man coueytous is armed by double ardour of money / and is enemy of trouthe / his auaryce is for to stele gold And by his febonye he leseth oure lord He hath no thyng / he prouffyteth no thyng / humayne cruelte is withdrawen by his wyndes and c And laurence goth to heuen / And he fayleth in his flammes / Of the quenchyng of the fifthe fire / that is of the furyous woodenes / how that is to say furyous woodenes of the persecutoure was deceyued and brought to nought / Seyth Seynt Maxymyn thus / whan the woodenes of the mynystres of the flāmes was surmōted / he restrayned the brennyng of the worldly wodenes And tyll that tyme the deuyls entent prouffyted / tyll that the trewe man ascended / and mounted in to heuen gloryously vnto his lord god / And he made to c And sheweth that the woodenes of the persecutours / was fyre / whanne he sayde / the woodenesse of the Paynyms maade redy a gredel of yron vppon the fyre strongly brennyng / And that was done / to thende / that he sholde auenge the fyres and grete heetes of indignacion And it was no wonder / though he surmounted these thre grete fyres without forth / For as it is had of the wordes of the sayd maxymyn / he had within forth thre refroydours or coldes / and bare in his herte thre fyres / by whiche he assuaged by coldenes all the fyre with oute forth / And surmounted with thēbracynge of more fyre / And the firste coldenes / was the desyre of celestyalle glorye / Che second was the remembraunce of the lawe of god / And the thirde was the clennes of his conscyence / By this treuble coldenes he quenchid alle the fyre withoute forth / And he was cold of the fyrst refraydeur / whiche is desyre of heuenly glorye / as saynt Ambrose sayth / the blessid Laurence myghte not fele the tormentes of fire in his entraylles / whiche within hym posseded the refraidour of paradis Though the brente flesshe laye to fore the tyraunt / and the body brente / Neuertheles the body suffred no payne in erth whoos sowle and courage was in heuen / Of the second coldenes or refraideur / that is the remembraunce of the lawe of god he sayth thus / whan he remēbryd to fore the commaundementes of Ihesu Cryst / al was cold that he suffred / Of the thyrde whiche is purete & clennes of conscyence he sayth thus / the right strong martir truly is brente in his entraylles / but he sechyng the kyngdome of heuen / enioyeth / as a vaynqueur / by the refroydour of the clennes of his conscyence / And as saynt Maxymyn sayth / he had thre fyres within forth / by the whiche he surmonnted by embracyng al the fyres withoute forth The fyrst was the gretenes of the faith The second the ardaunt dilection / The thyrdde the very knowlege of god whiche embracyd hym as fyre / Of the first fyre sayth saynt Ambrose / As moche as the brennyng of the feyth chauffeth hym / so moche coled hym the flamme of the torment / We rede in the gospell that the fyre of the feythe is the fyre of the sauyoure / ¶ Theuangelyst sayd / I cam in to the erthe to put fyre therin / And with this fyre was saynt laurence embraced and felte not the brennyng of the flammes / And of the second fyre he sayth thus / the martir laurence brenned withoute forth of thembracementes of the tyraūt but the gretter flamme of the loue of god / brenned hym within forthe / Of the thyrdde fyre he sayth thus / The right cruell flamme of the persecutour myght not surmounte the martir / For he was ouer moche more ardauntly chauffed in his thought / by the rayes of trouth that he felte not the flamme withoute forthe / which he vaynquysshyd and ouercam Laurence among the other martirs hath thre pryueleges as toward offyce The fyrst he hath only a Vygyle among al the other martirs But at this day the Vygyles of sayntes ben chaunged in to fastynges / by many / And as Mayster Iohan Beleth reherseth / It was somtyme the customme / that the men wente with theyr wyues and children at the solempnyte of feestes / And woke there alle the nyght with tapers and lyght / but by cause many aduentures were made in these Vygyles / It was establysshed / that the Vygyles shold be torned in to fastynges / And neuertheles the auncyent name is reteyned / And is yet reteyned / And is called Vygyle / The second pryuelege is in the Octabas or vtas / For he only with saynt stephen haue their octauas among all other martirs / lyke as saynt Martyn hath among the Confessours / The thirde is in the reprysyng of the anthemys For he only and saynt pawle haue that only / But powle hath that for thexcellence of his prechyng / And Laurence for thexcellence of his passion / •rporalle mater / •le the cruelte of the persecutours confused all wyth theyr fires / ¶ ¶Thus endeth the lyf of saynt Laurence martir ¶Here foloweth of saynt ypolite martir and first of his name YPOlitus is said of yper / that is as moche to say / as vpon and lytos / that is a stone / as who sayth vppon a stone / that is to vnderstonde founded vppon Crist / Or of in / and polys / that is a Cyte / Or Ypolitus is as moche to say / as polysshed / he was wel founded vpon the stone Crist / by constance and stedfastnes / he was in the cyte aboue by desyre / and coueytyng / he was polysshed by the bitternes of his tormentes / YPolyte buryed the body of saynt laurence / And after he cam in to his hows / and yaf the pees to his seruauntes / and to hys Chamberyers / And commyned them with the sacrament of the aulter / whiche Iustyne the preest had sacred / And the table was couerd / but or he took ony mete / the knyghtes cam / and haled hym awey / and brought hym to themperour / And when decyan themperoure sawe hym / he smylyng sayd to hym / Arte thow now made an enchanteur / whiche hast borne aweye the body of Laurence / And Ypolyte sayd / that haue I done / not as an enchaunteure / but as a Crysten man / Thenne decian beyng replenysshed with grete suroure commaunded / that he shold be despoylled of his habyte / that he ware as a Cristen man / and that his mouthe sholde be beten with stones / To whome ypolyte sayd / thou hast not despoylled me but rather clothed / To whome decian seyd / how is it / that thow art now so felysshe / that art not ashamed of thy nakednes / Now therfore make thou sacryfyse / and thou shalt lyue / or elles thou shalt perysshe with laurence / to whome ypolyte sayd / I wold / I myght be made thexample of saynt laurence / whome thou presumest to name with thy fowle mouthe / and pollute / Thenne decyan made hym to be beten with stones and all to rente with combes of yron / And he confessid with a clere wys / that he was Crysten / and whan he had despysed these tormentes / he dyde hym to be clothed with the vesture of a knyght / that he to fore vsed / in exhortyng hym that to receyue his amytye / and his first chyualrye / And Ypolyte sayde I am the knyght of Ihesu crist / & thenne Decyan replenysshed with greete wrath delyuerd hym to Valeryan the prouost / & that he shold take alle his facultees / & slee hym by dyuerse tormētes / And thenne he fonde that alle the meyne of ypolytes hows were crysten / And alle were brought to fore hym / & when he wolde haue constreyned them to do sacryfyse / One named Concordia Nouryce of ypolyte answerd for them alle / we had leuer deye with oure lord chastely / than lyue synfully / & thenne decian beyng present / commaunded that she shold be beten with plometttis of leede vnto the tyme / that she gaf ouer her spyryte / & ypolyte sayd / Syre I thank the / that thou hast sente my nouryce to fore the sight of thy sayntes / & after that Valeryan dide do lede ypolite with his meyne to the yate Tyburt comforted them alle / & said bretheren drede you not for ye & I haue one only god / & thenne Valeryan cōmanded that all they shold ben byheded before ypolyte / & thenne he made ypolyte to be bounden by the feet vnto the neckes of wylde horses / and made hym to be drawen among thornes / bryeres & roches tylle he rendryd & gaf to god his spyryte / he deyde aboute the yere of our lord CC lxvi / And thenne Iustyn the preest tooke the bodyes of them & buryed them by the body of saynt Laurence but he couthe not fynde the body of seynt concorde For it was cast in to a preuy / A knyght that was named porphyre wende that the blessid Concord had gold and precious stones in her clothes and cam to a man named herenen / whiche was secretely a Crysten man / and sayd to hym / kepe my ceunuylle secrete / And drawe concorde oute of the preuy / For I trowe / that ther ben in her vestymentes gold and precious stones / And he sayd shewe to me the place / where she lyeth / And I shal kepe thy connceylle / And shalle telle to the what I shalle fynde / And thenne he drewe her oute of the preuy chambre / & fonde nothyng / And thēne the knyght fledde awey anone / And Hyreneus called to hym a Crysten man / named Abonde / And bare the body to seynt Iustyn / and he took it deuoutely / and buryed hit by the body of saynt ypolyte with the other / And whan Valeryen herd herof / he dyde do take Hyreneus & Abounde / and threwe them all quycke in to the preuy / And Iustyn took out their bodyes / and buryed them with the other / And after these thynges don decyen and Valeryen ascended in to a golden chare / for to go and tormenten Crysten men / And de cyen was rauysshed of a deuylle / and cryed / O Ypolyte hath boūden me with sharp chaynes and ledeth me awey / And Valeryen cryed also / O laurence thou drawest me with fyry chaynes / And the same houre Valeryen deyde / And decyan retorned home / and deyde the thyrdde daye / tormented of the deuylle / and cryed laurence cesse thow a lytel / I coniure the to cesse thy tormentes / and so deyde And whan Tryphonye his wyf / whiche was moche cruell / sawe this thyng she lefte alle / and tooke to Cyrylle her doughter / and wente to saynt Iustyn and dyd doo baptyse her / wyth many other / And that other day after that / as Tryphone praid she gaf vp her spyryte / and deyde / And Iustyn the preest buryed her body by saynt Ypolyte / And xlvij knyghtes / heryng that the quene and her doughter were becomen Crysten / cam with their wyues to Iustyn the preest / for to receyue baptysme / Claudius the emperour / whan Cyryll wold not doo sacryfyse / dyde do cutt her throte / & dyde do byhede the other knyghtes / And the bodyes were borne wyth the other in to the feld Verane / and there buryed / And it is to be noted here expressely / that Claudyus succeded decyen / whiche martred saynt laurence and saynt ypolyte / but he succeded not decyan themperour / For after the Cronykes Volusyan succeded decyan / and galyen succeded volusian / And claudius succeded galyen / soo it behoueth that galyen had two names / that is to wete galyan and decyan / and so said Vyncent in his Cronyke / and godeffroy in his booke / Galyan called one vnto his helpe that was named decyan / whome he made Cezar / but not emperour / so sayth Rychard in his cronyke / Of thys martir sayth Ambrose in his preface / The blessid martir Ypolyte considered / that Ihesu criste was very duke / and he wolde be his knyght / and had leuer be his knyght / than duke of knyghtes And he pursyewed not saynt laurence whiche was put vnder his kepyng / but folowed hym / soo that in suffryng martirdome he lefte the lawe of the tyraunt / and cam / and posseded the tresour of very rychesses / which is the glorye of the kyng pardurable and perpetuel / Ther was a carter / named Peter whiche yoked his oxen in the carte in the feste of marye magdalene / and folowed his oxen / and beganne to curse them / And anone the oxen and the cart were smyten with thonder / And that same peter / whiche had soo cursed was tormented of cruell tormentes / For fire took hym / so that he brente the senewes and the flessh fro his thye / and the bone appered / and that the thye & legge fyll of / thenne he wente to a chirche of oure lady / and hyd his legge in an hoole of the chirche / And prayd our lady with teres deuoutely for his delyueraunce / And on a nyght the blessyd Vyrgyne with saynt Ypolyte cam to fore hym in a vysyon / And she prayd to ypolyte that he wold restablysshe peter in his first helthe / And anone saynt ypolyte tooke his legge in the hole and tooke and set it in his place / like as on graffyth in a tree / And he felte soo moche payne in that vysyon / that he awoke and cryed so lowde / that he awoke alle the meyne / and they aroos and tooke lyght / & sawe that peter had two legges & two thyes / but they had supposed that it had be illusion / & they tasted yet / & yet efte ageyne / and saw that he had veryly his membrys / & thēne they awoke hym / & demanded of hym hou it happed / •ne / & ypolyte And he wende / that they had mocked hym / And whan he sawe it / he was all abasshed / yet neuertheles the newe thye was softer than the olde / And myghte not wel susteyne his body therwith / And by cause this myracle sholde be publysshed / he halted an hoole yere / And thenne the blessyd Vyrgyne apperyd to hym and saynt to saynt Ypolyte / that he shold perfourme that whiche apperteyned to that cure / And thēne he awoke / and felt hym self al hool And thenne he entred in to a recluage To whome the deuylle apperid oftyme in the lykenes of a woman naked / and ioyned to hym naked / And the more he defended hym / the more the deuylle approched ner in temptynge hym shamefully / And whan he had ben shamefully trauayled of her / he took the stole of a preestes necke / and gyrd hym with hit / And anon the deuyll departed / And lefte lyeng there a stynkyng and roten careyne / And so greete stenche yssued / that ther was none that sawe it / but said that it was the body of somme deed woman / whiche the deuylle had taken ¶Thus endeth the lyf of saynt ypolyte ¶ Here foloweth the assumpcion of the glorious vyrgyne oure lady saynt Marye WE fynde in a book sente to saynt Iohan theuangelyst / or elles the book whiche is sayd to be apocriphum is ascrybed to hym / In what maner the Assumpcion of the blessid Vyrgyn saynt Marye was made / Thappostles were departed / and gone in to dyuerse Countrees of the world / for cause of prechyng / And the blessyd lady and Vyrgyne was in an hows by the mount of Syon / And as long as she lyued / she vysyted all the places of her sone with grete deuocion / that is to say the place of his baptysme Of his fastyng / of his passion / of his sepulture / of his resurection / and of his ascencion / And after that Epyphanes sayth / she lyued four and twenty yere after thascencion of her sone / And he sayth also / whan our lady had conceyued Ihesu Cryste / she was of the age of fourten yere / And she was delyuerd in the xv yere / And lyued and abode with hym thre and thyrty yere And after his dethe / she lyued foure and twenty yere / And by this acompt whan she departed oute of this world she was lxxij yere old / but hit is more probable / that / whiche is red in another place / that she lyued after the ascencion of hyr sone twelue yere / And soo thenne she was lx yere old / And on a day whan alle thappostles were sprad thurgh the world in prechyng / the gloryous vyrgyne was gretely esprysed and embraced with desyre to be wyth her sone Ihesu Crist / And her courage eschaufed was moued / And grete habundaunce of teres ranne without forth by cause she had not egally the comfortes of her sone / whiche were withdrawē from her for the tyme / And an angell cam to fore her with grete lyght / and salewed her honourably / as the moder of his lord / sayenge / Al hayll blessid Mary / receyuyng the blyssyng of hym that sente his blessyng to Iacob / lo here a bowhe of palme of paradis lady whiche I haue brought to the / whiche thou shalt commaunde to be born to fore thy bere / For thy sowle shalle be taken fro thy body / the thirdde day next folowyng And thy sone abydeth the his honourable moder / To whome she answerd / yf I haue founde grace to fore thyn eyen I pray the that thou vouchesauf to shewe to me thy name / And yet I praye the more hertely / that my sones and my bretheren thappostles may be assembled with me / soo that to fore I deye / I may see them with my bodely eyen / And after to be buryed of them / And they beyng here / I maye yelde vp my ghoost to god / And also yet I praye and requyre / that my spyryte yssuyng oute of the body / see not the horryble / ne wycked spyryte ne fende / And that no myght of the deuylle come ageynste me / And thenne the Aungel sayd / lady wherfor desyrest thow to knowe my name / whiche is grete and merueylous All thappostles shall assemble this daye to the / and shal make to the noble exequyes at thy passyng / And in the presence of them / thow shlat gyue vp thy spyry And wherfor doubtest thou to see the wycked spyrytes / sythr thou haste broken vtterly his heed / And hast despoylled hym from thempyre of his power / Neuertheles thy wyll be doone / that thou see not the fen And this said the Angel moūted in to heuen with grete lyght / and the palme shone by right grete clerenes and was lyke to a grene rodde / whoos leues shone lyke to the morowe sterre / And it happed as saynt Iohan the euangelyst prechid in Ephesym / the heuen sodenly thondred / And a whyte clowde took hym vp / and brought hym to fore the yate of the blessyd Vyrgyn Mary / And he knocked at the dore / & entryd / and salewed the Vyrgyn honourably / whome the blessid Vyrgyne behelde / and was gretely abasshed for Ioye / and myght not absteyne her fro wepyng / And sayd to hym / Iohan sone remembre the of the worde of thy mayster / by whiche he made me moder vnto the / And the a sone vnto me / loo I am called of thy mayster / and my god / I paye now the dette of condicion humayne / And recomende my body vnto thy besy cure / I haue herd saye that the Iewes haue made a counceyll and sayd / late vs abyde bretheren vnto the tyme that she that bare Ihesu be deed / And thenne incontynent we shall take her body / and shalle caste it in to the fire / and brenne it / Thou therfore / take this palme / And bere it to fore the bere whan ye shall bere my body to the sepulcre / Thenne said Iohan / O wold god that alle my bretheren thappostles were here / that we myght make thyn exequyes couenable / as it houeth / and is dygne and worthy / And as he seyd / that alle the Appostles were rauysshed with clowdes fro the places where they prechyd / and were brought to fore the dore of the blessid Vyrgyne Marye / And whan they sawe them assembled they merueyled / and sayde / For what cause hath oure lord assembled vs here / Thenne saynt Iohan wente oute and sayd to them / that oure lady shold passe and departe oute of this world / and added more to sayeng / bretheren beware and kepe yow from wepyng whan she shalle departe / by cause that the peple that shalle see it / be not troubled / And sayde / loo these how they drede the dethe / whiche preche to other the resurection / And denys disciple of pawle affermeth this same in the booke of dyuyne names / That is to wete / that alle thappostles were assembled at the assumpcion and dethe of oure lady / Marye / & were to geder there / And that eche of them made a sermon vnto the praysyng and laude of Ihesu Crist / and the blessyd Vyrgyn his moder / he saide thus spekyng to Thymothee / Thus we and thou as thow well knowest / And many of oure hooly bretheren dyde assemble at the vysyon of the moder / that receyued god / And Iames broder of god was there / And Peter thappostle moost noble and souerayne of the theologyens / And after that me semed

Angels the companyes of patriarkes / thassembles of martirs / the Couentes of Confessours / the Carolles of Virgyns / And to fore the bed of oure blessid lady the companyes of alle these sayntes were sette in ordre / And made swete songe and melodye / And what exequres were done of our blessid lady and there halowyd / hit is all sayd and enseygned in the forsaid book / whiche is attrybued to saynt Iohan / ¶ For first Ihesu Crist began to saye / Come my chosen / and I shalle sette the in my sete / For I haue coueyted the beaute of the / And oure lady answerd / Syre my herte is redy / And alle

the flesshe / as she was fro corrupcion of her body / Thenne sayd oure lord to thappostles / Bere ye the body of thys Vyrgyne my moder in to the vale of Iosephat / And leye ye her in a newe sepulcre / that ye shalle fynde there / And abyde me there thre dayes / tyll •• / For he that brought the prophete by an heer / fro Iudee to Babylone may withoute doute sodenly in an hour bryng thappostles to

were the company of aungels / of Confessours / and Vyrgyns / ¶ And thappostles cryed after her sayeng / Ryght wyse Vyrgyne / whyther gooste thow / lady remembre the of vs / ¶ And thenne the companye of sayntes that were abyden / were awaked with the sowne of the songe of them / that mounted / and cam ageynst her / And sawe their kynge bere in his propre armes the sowle of a woman / & sawe y t this sowle was Ioyned to hym & were abasshed & began to crye sayeng Who is this / that ascendeth fro deserte fulle of delyces Ioyned to her to her frende / And they that accompanyed her said / this is the right fayre among the doughters of Ierusalem / And lyke as ye haue sene her fulle of charyte and dylection / so is she ioyously receyued / And sette in the sete of glory on the right syde of her sone / And thappostles sawe the sowle of her beyng so whyte / that no mortal tonge myghte expresse it / And thenne thre maydens that were there tooke of the clothes fro the body / for to wesshe it / the body anone shone by so grete clernes / that they myght wel fele hit in touchyng and wasshyng / but they myght not see it / And that lyght shone as long as they were aboute the wasshyng of it / And thenne thappostles took the body honourably / and leyde it on the bere / And Iohan sayd to Peter bere this palme to fore the buere / For oure lord hath ordeyned the aboue vs / And hath made the pastour and prynce of his sheep To whome peter sayde / It apperteyneth beitre to the to bere it / For thou art chosen Vyrgyn of oure lord / And thow oughtest to bere this palme of lyghte / atte

the bere / And Peter beganne to synge and say / Israel is yssued oute of Egypte / And the other Apostles folowed hym in the same songe / And our lord couerd the bere and thappostles with a clowde / soo that they were not sene but the voys of them was herd only / And the Aungels were with thappostles syngyng / and replenysshed all the londe with merueylous swetnes / And thenne alle the peuple was moeued with that swete melodye and yssued hastely oute of the cyte / & enquyred what hit was / And thenne ther were somme that sayde to them / that Mary suche a woman is deed / & the disciples of her sone Ihesu bare her and made suche melody as ye here about her / And thenne ran they to armes / & they warned eche other sayeng / Come and late vs slee alle the disciples / and late vs brenne the body

Ihesu cryste / and in this that bere hym / I wene & hope that thou soone shalt haue helthe and be al hoole / And he answerd / I byleue our lord Ihesu Crist to be the sone of god / And that this is his

Ihesu Crist that this woman bare in her bely / and remayned Vyrgyn after the chyldyng / And when he had so sayd / he was anone all hoole parfiʒtely / And thenne saide peter to hym / Take that palme of

thappostles bare marye vnto the monument / And satte by it lyke as oure lord had commaunded / And at the thyrdde day Ihesu crist cam with a grete multytude of Angels and salewed them / and saide pees be with yow / And they answerd / god / glory be to the / whiche only makest the grete myracles and merueyles / And oure lord sayd to thappostles / what is now youre aduys / that I ought now to doo to my moder of honour / and of grace / Syre it semeth to vs thy seruauntes / that lyke as thou hast vaynquysshyd the deth / and regnest world with oute ende / that thou reyse also the body of thy moder / and sette her on thy ryʒt side in perdurabylyte / And he graunted it / And thenne Mychael the angel cam / and presented the sowle of Marye to oure lord / And the saueour spacke and sayde / Aryse vp / haste the my culuer or douue / tabernacle of glorye / vessel of lyf / Temple celestyal / And lyke as thou neuer feltest conceyuyng by none atouchement / thou shalt not suffre in the sepulcre no corrupcion of body / And anon the sowle cam ageyne to the body of marye / and yssued gloryously oute of the tombe / and thus was receyued in the heuenly chambre / and a grete companye of angels with

vnderstode that she was assumpt in to heuen / And alle this here to fore is sayd / and called Appcriphum / Wherof saynt Ierom sayth in a sermon to paula and Eustochium / ber doughter / That book is said to be apocryfum sauf that somme wordes whiche hen worthy of feythe / and ben approued of seyntes as touchyng nyne thynges / that is to wete / that the comforte of thappostles was promysed / and

/ and the peple folowed hym / And anone all the hoost of thenemyes were tourned in to franesye / and were blynde / and trembled / and all were abasshed / And when they of the cyte sawe this thyng / aboue the dyuyne demonstraunce / they wente on egrely / and slewe their enemyes the which thyng displesid moche the vyrgyn saynt Marye as it was proued by that / that her cote vanysshed awey / And the duk their enemy fonde it in his lappe / It is redde in the reuelacions of saynt Elysabeth / that on a time as she was rauisshed in spyryte / she sawe in a place moche fer fro folk a tombe or a sepulcre enuyronned with moche lyght / and was like the forme of a womā within forth And there were aboute it a grete multytude of angels / and a lytell whyle after she was taken oute of the sepulcre / and borne vp on hyghe with that multitude / And thenne cam ageynst her a man beryng in his right arme the signe of the crosse / & had with hym many angels withoute nombre / whiche receyued her moche ioiously / and ledde her with grete melodye in to heuen / and a litel whyle after / Elyzabeth demaunded of an angel / to whom she spak ofte / of that vysion that she saw / It is shewed to the / sayde the aungel in that vysyon that the vyrgyn oure lady is assumpt in to heuen as wel in her body as in her sowle / It is said in the same reuelacions / that it was shewed to her / that the xl day after the sowle departed fro her body she was so assumpt in to heuen & also / y t when oure blessid lady spak to her she said / After thascencion of our lorde an hole yere and as many dayes more as ben fro the assencion vnto her assumpcion she ouer lyued / ¶ And also she sayd alle thappostles were at my departynge / and buryed my body honourably / And xl dayes after was reysed / And thenne saynt Elyzabeth demaunded of her / whether she shold hyde this thynge / or that she shold manyfeste it / and shewe it / And she sayd / It is not to be shewed to flesshely ne vnbyleuyng peuple / ne it is not to be hyd to deuoute and crysten peple •su crist / and the It is to be noted / that the gloryous vyrgyne Marye was assumpt & lyfte vp in to heuen entyerly / Ioyously and gloryously / She was receyued entyerly / that is holly as the chirche byleueth debonayrly / And that afferme many sayntes / and enforce them to proue it by many reasons / And the reason of saynt Bernard is suche / he sayth that god hath made the body of saynt Peter and saynt Iames so gloryously to be honoured / that he hath enhaunsed them by merueylous honour / that to them is deputed place couenable for to be worshiped / And alle the world goth to seke and offre to them / Thenne yf the body of his blessid moder were on the erthe And not haunted by deuoute vysytacion of cristen men / it shold be merueyll to here / that god wold not haue done as moche worship to his moder and honoured as moche her body / as the bodyes of other sayntes vpon the erthe / Iherome sayth thus / that the Vyrgyn Marye mounted in to heuen / the xviij kalendas of septembre / That he sayth this of thassumpcion of the body of Marye / but the chirche wyl rather debonayrly byleue it / than folysshly to doubte it / And he preued it afterward / that it is to be byleued / y t they y t aroos with oure lord haue accomplysshyd their perdurable resurection / wherfore shold not we say thenne / that it is done in the blessid Vyrgyne Marye / & also many byleue that saynt Ioh̄n the euangelyst is gloryfyed in his flesshe with Ihesu crist / And thenne moche more oure lady ought to be gloryfyed in heuen bothe body and sowle / whiche sayth / worshipe thy fader and moder / And he cam not to breke the lawe / but to fulfylle it / And therfor he honoureth his moder aboue all other / ¶ Seynt Austyn affermeth not thys only / but he preueth it by thre reasons And the first reason is the vnyte and assemble of the flesshe of oure lord and of oure lady / And sayth thus putrefaction / and wormes is the reproche of condycion humayne / whiche Ihesus neuer touched / And the flesshe of Ihesu is out of this repreef / the nature of marye is oute of therof / For it is preued that Ihesu criste hath taken his flesshe of her / ¶The second reason is / that the dygnyte of the body of her / of whome hym self sayth / this is the syege of god / the chambre of oure lord of heuen / and the tabernacle of crist / she is worthy to be where he is / soo precious a tresour is more worthy to be kepte in heuen than in erthe The thyrdde reason is parfyght entyernes of her vyrgynall flesshe / and saith thus / Enioye thou marye of honourable gladnes in body and in sowle / In thy prppre sone / And by thy propre sone thou oughtest to haue no harme of corrupcion / where thou haddest none corrupcyon of vyrgynyte in chyldyng so grete a sone / so thou whome he endewed with so grete glorye be alwey withoute corrupcyon / and lyue entyerly / whiche barest entyer hym / that is parfyght of alle / And that she be with hym whome she bare in her wombe / and that she be at hym whome she chylded / gaf sowke / and norysshed / Marye moder of Ilesu Crist admynystresse and seruaunt / And by cause I may none other thyng fele / I dare none other wyse say / ne presume / And herof sayth a noble Versyfyer thus / Transit ad ethera / virgo puerpera / virgula Iesse / Non sine corpore / sed sine tempore tendit ad esse / ¶The vyrgyne that chylded mounted vnto heuen / the lytel rodde of Iesse / not withoute body / but withoute tyme she entendeth to be there vyrgyne pure and uette / ¶ Secondly / she was assumpte and take vp gladly And herof sayth Gerard bisshop / and martir in his Omelye / The heuenes receyued this day the blessid vyrgyne / The Angels were glad / tharchangels enioyed / The Thrones songen / The domynacyons maden melodye / The pryn armonysed / The potestate harped / Cherubyn and Seraphyn songen louynges and preysynges / And bryngyng her with thankynges and laudes vnto the syege of the dyuyne and souerayne mageste / Thyrdly / she was lyfte vp in to heuen so honourably / that Ihesu Crist hym self with al the strengthe of the heuenly company cam ayenst her / Of whome saynt Ierome sayth / Who is he that is suffysaunt to thynke how the gloryous quene of the world wente vp this day / And how the multytude of the celestyall legyons cam ageynst her with grete talent of deuocion And with what songes / she was brought vnto her sete / And how she was receyued of her sone and embraced with peasyble chere and clere face / And hou she was enhaunced aboue all other creatures / And yet he sayth / it is on thys day / that the Chyualrye of heuen cam hastely for to mete with the moder of god / and enuyronned her with greete lyght / and brought her to her sete with preysynges and songes spyrytuel / And thenne enioyed them the celestyall company of Ierusalem with soo greete gladnes / that no man may recounte / ne telle / and made ioye and song alle enioyeng in charyte / by cause that this feste is euery yere halowed of vs / and made and contynued to all other / And it is to byleue / that the sauyoure hym self cam and met with her hastely And brought her with hym and sette her in her sete with greete ioye / And how hadde he acomplysshed otherwyse that whiche he commaunded in the lawe sayeng / honoure thy fader and moder / ¶ Fourtly / she was receyued excellently / And she was there enhaunced in the heuenly kyngdome / And honouryd gloryously syttyng next vnto Cryst / And how she is enhaunsed in the heuenly glorye / Gerard the bisshop reherceth in his Omelyes / sayeng / Oure lord Ihesu Crist may preyse this blessid Vyrgyne his moder / as he dyd / and magnefye / soo that she be contynuelly preysed of that mageste and honoured / And enuronned of the company of Angels enclosed with the turmes of Archangels / posseded of the thrones / & gyrde about enuyronned with the seruyce of the potestates / beclypped with thembracementes of the pryncipates / enioyed with the honoures of the vertues / obeyed with laudes and praysynges of the cherubyns / and possessed on alle partes with not recountable sōges of the Seraphyns / And the ouer grete and ineffable Trynyte enioyeth in her perdurable gladnes / And hys grace redoundeth all in her / And maketh all other to entende and awayte on her / the ouer shynyng ordre of thappostles honoure hir with ineffable laude / the honourable multitude of martirs besechen her in all maner / as to one soo grete a lady / The felaushyp of Confessours innumerable contynue their song to her / The ryght noble and whyte company of vyrgyns makē noble carollyng of the glorye of her / Helle full of malyce howleth / And the cursed deuyls crye vnto her / and drede her / There was a clerke deuoute vnto the Vyrgyye Marye / whiche studyed euery daye / how he myghte comforte her ageynste the payne of the fyue woundes of Ihesu Crist sayeng thus / Reioyce the vyrgyne / and moder vndefowled whiche receyuest the ioye of the angels Enioye that thou conceyuedest / Enioye the / that childest the lyght of clernes / Enioye the moder / whiche neuer were touched / Alle fetures and all creatures prayse the moder of lyghte / be thou for vs alweye prayeng to oure lord

grete sekenes / And cam toward his ende / he beganne to drede & was troubled / And oure blessid lady appered to hym / and sayd / Sone / wher for tremblest thou by so grete fore / whiche hast so ofte shewed to me ioye / be thou Ioyefull now thy self / And that thou mayste enioye perdurably come with me / Ther was a monke moche Ioly and lyght of his lyuyng / but deuoute to oure lady / whiche on a nyght wente to doo his folye acustomed / But whan he passyd byfore the aulter of her lady / he salewed the Vyrgyne and so wente forth oute of the chirche And as he sholde passe a Ryuer / He fylle in the water and drowned / and the deuyls tooke the sowle / thenne cam Angels for to delyuer it / And the deuyls sayd to them / wherfor come ye hyder / ye haue no thyng in this sowle / And anone the blessid Virgyn Marye cam / and blamed them / by cause they had taken the sowle / whiche was heres And they sayd that they had founden hym fynysshyng his lyf in euyll werkes / And she sayd / hit is fals that ye saye / I knowe well / that whan he wente in to ony place / he salewed me first / And whan he retorned and cam ageyne also / And yf ye say / that I do yow wrong kyng / And whan they strofe to fore our lord of this mater / It plesyd hym / that the sowle shold retorne ageyne to the body And repente hym of his synnes and trespaces / And thenne the bretheren sawe that the matyns were ouer longe differred / and sought the sextayn / and wente to the Ryuer / and found hym there drowned / And whan they had drawen the body oute of the water / what they shold doo / they wyst not / and merueyled what he had done / and sodenly he cam ageyne to lyfe / and told what he had done / and after finysshed his lyfe in good werkes / Ther was a knyght / whiche was myghty and ryche / that dispended folyly his goode / and cam to so grete pouerte that he / whiche had ben acustomed to gyue largely grete thynges / had nede to demaunde and aske the smale / And he had a right chast wyf / and moche deuoute / to the blessid Vyrgyne marye / And a grete solempnyte approched at the whiche the knyght was acustomed to gyue many gyftes / And he had nothyng to gyue / wherof he was gretely ashamed / And he wente in to place deserte ful of heuynes / and of wepyng / soo long that the feste was passed / for to wayle there his euylle fortune / and for teschewe shame / And anone a knyghte moche horryble cam syttyng on an hors / whiche arresonned the knyght / and enquyred of hym the cause of his grete heuynes / And he told hym al by ordre that / as was happed to hym / And this fowle knyght sayd to hym / yf thow wylt a lytel obeye to me / thou shalt habounde in glorye / and in rychesse more / than thou were to fore / And he promysed to the deuyl / that he wold doo so gladly / yf he acomplysshed that he promysed / And thenne he sayd to hym / goo home in to thyne hows / and thou shalt fynde in suche a place there soo moche gold / and soo moche syluer / And thow shalt fynde there also precious stones / And doo so moche / that suche a day thou brynge me hyther thy wyf / And the knyghte retorned home in to his hows / and fonde alle thyng lyke as the deuylle had promysed / And anone he bought a palays / and gaf grete gyftes / and bought ageyne his herytage / and took his men ageyn to hym / And the day approched which he had promysed to lede his wyf to the fende / And called her / late vs goo to hors back / For ye must come with me / vnto a place fer hens / And she trembled and was aferd / and durste not gaynsaye the commaundement of her husbond / And she commaunded her

in to the chirche / her husbōd abode withoute / And as she commaunde her deuoutely to the blessid Vyrgyne Marye in grete deuocion and contemplacion she sodenly slepte / And the gloryous Vyrgyne dyde on semblable habyte of this lady / and departed fro the aulter / and yssued oute / and mounted vppon the hors / And the lady abode slepyng in the chirche / And the knyght wende / that she had ben his wyf / that was with hym / and wente alwey forth / And whan he was comen to the place assigned / the deuylle cam wyth a grete Rese to the place / And whan he approched / and cam ner / he quaked & trembled anon / and durste go no ner / • / lete vs putt it ageyne in Iugement of the souerayne Thenne sayd he to the knyght / thow moost traytoure of alle men / wherfore hast thou deceyued me / and

thou hast brought to me Marye / For thy wyf hath done to me many iniuryes / wherfor I wold take on her vengeaunce / And thou hast brought to me this for to tormente me / and for to sende me to helle / And whan the knyghte herd this / he was sore abasshed / and myght not holde hym fro wepyng / ne durst not speke for drede and merueyle / And thenne the blessid Mary sayde Thou felon spyryte by what

oure lady blamed hym / and commaunded hym to retorne ageyne to his wyf / whiche yet slepte in the chirche / & bad hym that he shold caste awey alle the Rychesses of the deuylle / And whan he cam ageyne / he fond his wyf yet slepyng / and awoke her / and told to her alle that was byfallen / And whan they were comen home / they threwe aweye alle the rychesses of the deuylle / and duellyd alwey in the louynges of oure lady / and receyued afterward many rychesses that our lady gaf to them There was a man / whiche was rauysshed in Iugement to fore god / For he had moche synned / and the deuyl was there and sayd / ye haue nothyng on this sowle / but it ought to be myn / For I haue therof an Instrument publyque / To whome oure lord sayd / where is thyn Instrument / I haue he said an Instrument / that thou saydest with thy propre mouthe / and hast ordeyned it for tendure perpetuelly / For thou saydest / in what houre that ye eten of it / ye shalle dye / And this is of the lygnage

deuyll sayd yet ageyne / the sowle is myn / For yf he hath done ony good dedes / the wykked dedes passen the good withoute comparyson / And thenne our lord wold not anon gyue sentence ageynst hym / soo that he gaf hym terme of eyght dayes / soo that at the ende of eyght dayes / he shold appere ageyne to fore hym / and gyue acomptes of alle these thynges / And as he wente fro the vysage of oure

helpe the manly for the first / And he demaunded of hym his name / And he sayde Veryte / And after he found another / whiche promysed to helpe hym for the second / And when he had asked his name / he sayd his name was rightwysenes / At the eyghte day he cam to the dome to fore the Iuge / and the deuylle opposid to hym the first caas / and trouthe answerd and sayd / We knowe well that ther is double deth / corporelle and Infernal / and this Instrument that the deuylle alledgeth ageynste the speketh no word of the dethe of helle / but of the deth of the body / And of that it is clere that al men be enclosed in that sentence / that is to wyte that he dyeth in his body / and that is not the deth of helle / And as touchyng the dethe of the body the sentence endureth alwey / but as to the dethe of the sowle / it is repelled by the dethe of Ihesu Criste / Thenne the deuylle sawe / that he was discharged of the fyrste / Thenne he opposed and alledged the second / but rightwysenes cam / &

were assembled with the in Ierusalem / And saint Denys Ariopagite witnessith the same sayeng / We as I knowe wel / and they and many of oure bretheren were assembled for to see the body of her that bare god / And Iames the broder of god / And Peter the right noble and souerayne of theologyens were present And after it plesyd them / that after this vysyon / alle the souerayne prestes songen louynges after that eche of them had conceyued in his thought of the boūte of her / And seynt Cosme in folowyng the narracion sayth / And after this a grete thonder knokketh at the hows with soo

with a grete multytude of Angels / & tooke the sowle of his moder / And the sowle of her shone by soo grete lyght / that none of thappostles myght beholde it / And our lord sayd to saynt Peter Burye the corps of my moder with grete reuerence / And kepe it there thre dayes dylygently / And I shalle thenne come ageyne / and transporte her vnto heuen withoute corrupcion / And shalle clothe her of the semblable clernesse of my self / whiche that I haue taken of hyr / And that whiche she hath taken of me shall be assembled to geder & acorde That same saynt Cosme reherceth a dredefull and a merueylous mysterye of dissencion naturell and of curyous in quysycyon / For alle thynges that ben sayd of the gloryous vyrgyne moder of god / ben merueylous aboue nature / and ben more to doute than

hondes by his deseruyng / for bothe his handes were cut of by the wrestes / & henge on the bere / & he was tormēted by horrible sorow / & he requyred pardon / and promysed amendes / And saynt peter sayd to hym thou blessyd vyrgyne / ¶ And that thou confesse also Ihesu Cryst the sone of god to be fourmed in her / And thenne whan he had soo done / his hondes were ioyned ageyne to his wrestys and was al hole / Thenne seynt peter took a leef of the palme / and gaf hit to hym / and sayde / Go in to the Cyte / and leye it on them that ben seke / and they that wylle byleue shalle receyue helthe / And thenne whan thappostles cam to the vale of Iosaphat / they fonde a sepulcre lyke vnto the sepulcre of our lord / And leyd therin the body with grete reuerence / but they durste not touche hit / whiche was the right holy vessell of god / but the sudary / in whiche she was wrappid and leyd it in the sepulture / And as thappostles were aboute the sepulcre after the commaundement of oure lord / At the thyrd day a clowde moche bryʒt enuyronned the sepulcre / And the vois of Angels was herd sowne swetely / And a merueylous odour was felte / swete smellyng / And whan oure lord was come and sene

of saynt Iohan euangelist in preysyng hym as kepar and garde of so noble vyrgyn / And notwithstondynge one of thappostles fayled at this grete solempnyte And whan he herd soo grete myracles he merueyled and requyred with grete desyre / that her sepulcre myght be opened for to knowe the trouthe of alle these thynges / And thappostles denyed it to hym / all sayd that it ought ynow to suffyse the wytnes of soo grete persones / to thende that lest parauenture the mysbyleued men shold say / that the body were stolen aweye / or drawen by thefte / And he thenne whiche was angry sayde / why defende ye to me that / whiche am semblable to yow in youre comyn tresours / And at the laste they opened the sepulcre / and fonde not the body / but they fonde only but the vestymentes and the

hangyng / and gate with grete prayers and labour of one Vyncente / whiche had the rule of thospytal that he myght there day and nyght serue the seke peple / Vyncent was aferd / and dredde / leste Rocke whiche was a yong flouryng man shold be smeton with the pestylence / but after that he cam / them that were seke / he blessid in the name of Cryste And as sone as he had touched the seke men they were al hoole / And they sayd and confessed as sone as this holy man Rocke was comen in / all they that were vexed and seke / And the fyre of pestylence had infected / he extynetyd it / and delyuerd alle the hospital of that sekenes / And after he wente thorugh the Towne / And eche hows / that was vexyd with pestylence / he entryd and with the signe of the Cross and mynde of the passion of Ihesu crist he delyuerd them alle fro the pestylence For whome someuer Rocke touched / anone the pestylence leste hym / And whan the town of water fallynge was delyuerd fro the contagyon of the pestylence / rocke went to the Cyte of Cenes whiche is a grete cyte of ytalye whiche no lasse pestylence vexed / And he it in a shorte place delyuerd it fro the pestylence / And fro thens he cam to come / whiche was thenne so full of pestylence / that vnnethe in alle the Towne coude not be founden one hows wyd therof / In tho dayes ther was at Rome a cardynal of the tytle of Anglerye / which is a prouynce of lombardye / and the blessid Rocke cam in to this cardynals place / And as he stode to fore hym a lytel / sodenly a merueylous comforte and hope entrid in to the courage of the cardynal / he vnderstode the yonge man saynt Rock to be right dere wyth god / For his chere / his maners / and his attemperaunce shewed it / wherfore he commended hym to Rocke / that he shold delyuer hym fro the pestylence / & conserue hym / And thenne Rocke dyd sygne in the cardynals forhede / and made with his fyngre a crosse / And anone an apparaunt signe and a veray crosse was seen impressid in his forhede And soo the cardynal was preserued fro the pestylence / Neuertheles for the nouelte of the thyng / he prayd saynt Rocke that the token of the crosse shold be take awey / lest therby he shold be to the peple a newe spectacle / Thenne Rocke exhorted the cardynal / that he shall bere the signe of the crosse of oure redemer in memorye of his passion in his forhede perpetuelly / and worshipe it reuerently / by whiche sygne he was delyuerd fro the hard pestylence / The cardynal thenne brought seynt Rocke to the pope / whiche anone sawe that is godly / a bryght raye and heuēly shynyng oute of the forheede of Rocke / And after whan his dyuyne vertue was knowen to the pope / Rock opteyned of hym full remission of synne / Thenne the cardynal bygan tenquyre of Rock of his lygnage and of his Countre / but rock affectyng no mortal glorye hyd his lignage / and receyued ageyne of the pope his blessynge / and departed fro hym / And abode at Rome with the same cardynall thre yere contynuelly / and laboured in vysytyng and helpyng the poure peple and them / that were seke of the pestylence / And after thre yere the cardynall beyng old deyd / And Rock for soke Rome / and cam to the Towne of Armyne a noble Cyte of Ytalye / Whiche also he delyuerd fro the sayd pestylence / And whan that Towne was delyuerd / he wente to the Cyte of Manasem in lombardye / whiche was also sore oppressid with seke men of the pestylence / whome with all his hert he serued dylygently / And by the helpe of god made that town quyte of the pestylence And fro thens wente to placence / For he vnderstode y t ther was grete pestilēce ¶ Rocke was euer of grete studye / how he myght in the name of Ihesu / & of his passion / delyuer mortal men fro the hurte of pestylence / And so an hole yere he vysyted the howses of poure men / and they that hadde moost nede to them / he dyd moost help / And was alwey in tho spytal / And whan he had ben long in tho spytall of placence / and had heled almoost alle the seke men ther in / Aboute mydnyght he herd in his slepe an Angel thus sayeng / O Rocke moost deuoute to cryste awake / & know thou that thou art smeton with the pestylence / studye now how thou mayst be cured / And anone he felt hym sore taken with the pestylence vnder his bothe armes / And he therof gaf thankynges to our lord / And he was so sore vexid with the payne / that they that were in thospytall were depryued of their slepe and rest of the nyʒt / Wherfor saynt rok aroos fro his bedde and wente to the vtterist place of thospytalle / and laye doune there abydyng the lyght of the day / And whan it was day the people goyng by / sawe hym accused the mayster of thospytal of offence that he suffred the pylgrym to lye withoute thospital but he purged hym of that defaut sayeng that the pylgrym was smyten with the pestylence / as ye see / And vnwetyng to vs he wente oute / Thenne the Cytezeyns incontynent put out saynt Rocke fro the Cyte and subarbes / lest by hym the Cyte myght be the more enfected / Th And we blyssyng god / And there and leues / alwey gyuyng thankyng to oure lord / sayeng / O Ihesu my sauyour I thank the that thou puttest me to afflyction / lyke to thyne other seruauntes by this odyous ardour of pestylence / and most meke lorde I byseche the to this deserte place / gyue the refrygery and comfort of thy grace / and his prayer fynysshed anon ther cam a clowde fro heuen by the lodge that saynt Rocke h and a bryght welle / whiche is there yet vnto this day / whos water saynt Rock drāk beyng sore a thurst / and therof had grete refresshyng of the grete hete that he suffred of the pestylence feuer / There was nygh vnto that woode a lytell vyllage / in whiche somme noble men dwellyd / among whome / ther was one wel byloued to god named gotard whiche had grete husbondry / and had a grete famylye / and h huntyng / among whome h hound by the ru thyng whan gotard had aduertysed ofte that he bare soo awey the brede / but he wyst not to whome ne wh and there beheld how famylyarly the hounde delyuerd the brede to saynt Rocke / thenne gotard reuerently salewed the holy man and approched to hym / but saynt Rock dredyng leste the contagyous ayer of the pestylence myght enfecte hym / sayd to hym / Frende goo fro me in good pees / For the moost vyolente pestylence holdeth me / Thenne Gotard wente his wey & lefte hym / / and retorned home / where by goddes grace he sayd thus to hym self alle stylle / This poure man whome I haue lefte in the wood and deserte / certeynly is the man of god / syth this hound withoute reason bryngeth to hym brede I therfore that haue sene hym doo soo / ought sonner to doo it / whiche am a cristen man / By this hooly medytacion Gotard retorned to Rocke / and sayd hooly pylgrym / I desyre to doo to the that thou nedest / and am auysed neuer to leue the / Thenne Rock thanked god whiche had sente to hym gotard / And he enformed gotard besyly in the lawe of Cryst / And whan they had ben a whyle to geder / the hoūd brought no more brede / Gotard axyd coūceyll how he myght haue brede / for more and more he hongred and axed remedye of saynt Rock / Seynt Rock exhorted hym after the text sayeng / In the swette of thy vysage thou shalt ete thy brede / and that he sholde retorne to the Towne / & leue all his goodes to his heyres / and folowe the wey of cryst / and demaunde brede in the name of Ihesu / Thenne gotard was ashamed to doo so where he was knowen / but at the last by the besy admonycion of saynt Rock / Gotard wente to placence / where as he had grete knowlege / and beggeth brede and almesse at the dore of one his gossyb / That same gossyb thretened sharpely Gotard and sayd / he shamed his lygnage / and frendes by this fowle and indecent beggyng / And put hym awey beyng wrothe and scornyng hym / For whiche cause Gotard was constreyned to begge besyly at the dores of other mē of the Cyte / And the same day the gossyb / that so had said to gotard was taken sore with the pestylence / and many other that denyed almesse to gotard / And thenne anone the Cyte of placence was enfect with contagyous pestylence and gotard retorned to the woode / & told to saynt Rocke all that was happed / And saynt Rock tolde to gotard to fore / that his gossib shold hastely dye whiche was done in dede / And saynt Rocke meued with pyte and mercy beyng full seke wente in to placence beyng ful of pestylence / And left gotard in the woode / And though seynt Rock were sore vexed with the pestylence / yet he with grete labour wente to placence And with touchynge and blyssyng he helpe and heled them alle / And also cured thospytal of the same Cyte / And he beyng sore seke and almost lame retorned ageyne to Gotard in to the wode / And many that herde that he and Gotard were in the place of the desert valeye cam te them / whome he found al with Rocke / And to fore them alle he dyde these myracles / the wylde heestes whiche wandred in the woode / what hurte sekenes / or swellyng they had / they ranne anone to saynt Rocke / and whan they were heled / they wold enclyne their heedes reuerently / and goo theyr weye / And a lytel whyle after Gotard and his felawes for certeyne necessitees / and erandes retorned in to placence / And lefte that tyme saynt Rock allone in the valleye / and saynt Rock made his prayers to almyghty god / that he myght be delyuerd fro the woūdes of pestylence / And in this prayer he fyl a slepe / And in the mene whyle retorned fro the Cyte / And whan he cam and ioyned hym to Rock slepyng / he herde the vois of an angel sayeng / O Rock frende of god / oure lord hath herd thy prayers / lo thou arte delyuerd fro the pestylence / and arte made al hoole And oure lorde comaundeth that thou take the weye towarde thy countre / with this sodeyn voys gotarde was astoned / whiche neuer to fore knewe the name of Rocke / And anone Rock awoke and felte hym self al hole by the grace of god / like as the Angel saide / And Gotarde tolde vnto Rock / how he had herde the aungel / and what he had said / thenne saynt Rock prayd gotarrd that he shold kepe his name secret them alle in godly werkes / And they thenne beganne to wexe hooly / wherin he exhorted them and confermed / and lefte them in that deserte valeye / And saynt Rocke as a pylgrym doyng peuaūce entended brennyng in the loue of god toward his Countrey / and cam to a prouyuce of bombardye called Anglerye / and applyed hym toward almaynewhere the lord of his prouynce made warre with his enemy / whoos knyghtes took saynt Rock / as a spye / & delyuerd hym to thr lord as a traytour / This blessid saynt alweye confessynge Ihesu crist was deputed vnto an hard and strayte pryson / And the blessid Rocke pacyently wente in to pryson / & suffred it gladly / where day and nyght remembryng the name of Ihesu commēdyd hym to god prayeng / that the pryson shold not disproufyte hym / but that he myght haue it for wyldernes & penaunce / And there he abode fyue yere in prayers / ¶ In the ende of the fyfthe yere whan god wold / that his sowle sholde be brouʒt in to y e felaushyp of his sayntes / and be alweye in the syght of god / he that bare mete to saynt Rocke in to the pryson / as he was acustomed euery day / he sawe a grete light and shynnng in the pryson / And saint Rocke knelyng on his knees prayeng whiche alle these thynges he told to his lord / And the fame herof ranne all aboute the cyte / soo that many of the Cytezeyns ranne to the pryson by cause of the nouelte of this thyng / And there sawe and byhelde it / and gaf laude therof to almyghty god / and accused the lord of cruelte / and woodenes / Thenne at the last whan saynt Rock knewe by the wyll of god / that he shold fynysshe his mortal lyf / called to hym the kepar of the pryson / and prayd hym that he wold goo to his lord / and to exhorte hym in the name of god / and of the glorious vyrgyn Marye / that he wold sende to hym a preest / of whome deyd he wold be confessid / whiche thynge was anone done / And whan he hadde confessid hym to the pr and deuoutely taken his blessyng / he prayd hym that he myght abyde allone thre dayes next folowyng for to be in his contemplacion / by whiche he myght the better haue mynde of the moost hooly passion of oure lorde / For Rocke felte wel tho / that the cytezeyns prayd the lord for his delyueraunce / whiche thynges the preest told to the lord / Ayd soo it was graunted to saynt Rocke tabyde there allone thre dayes / And in the ende of the thyrd day / the Angel of god cam to saynt Rock sayeng thus / O Rocke god sendeth me for thy

good crysten men whiche reuerently prayde in the name of Ihesu to the blessid Rock myght be delyuerd surely fro the stroke of pestylence / And this prayer soo made / he expyred / and yaf vp the

suche wyse / that withoute doubte they byleued hym to be the frende of god / And ther was at his hede a grete tapre brennyng / and another at his feet / by Whiche tapres alle his body was lyghte / Ferthermore / they fonde vnder his hede the forsayd table / by whiche they knewe the name of the blessid Rock by auctoryte / whiche name knowen / the moder of the lord of that Cyte knewe many yeres to

thynges / that is after the body and the sowle / Or denys may be sayd of Dyane that is Venus / the goddesse of beaute / and of syos that is to saye god / as who sayth / he is fayre to god / or as somme saye he is sayd of Dyonisia that is after ysydore a precious stone black / whiche is good ageynste dronkenesse / he was hasty in fleynge the the world by parfyght renonciacion / He was lyft vp by contemplacion by thynges within forth / he was fayre to god by beaute of vertues / He prouffyted to synnars ageynste dronkenesse of vyces / And he had many names to fore his conuersyon / For he was called Ariopogita for the strete that he dwellyd in / he was called theosophus / that is to saye wyse to god / Also of the wyse men of grece he is sayd vnto this daye perystera vranos / that is to say / the wynghe of heuen / For he flewe merueilously with the wynghe of spyrytualle vnderstandynge in to heuen / Also he was sayd Macharius that is blessyd Also he was sayd of his Countreye Ionicus / Ionica as sayth papye is one of the langages of grekes / Or Ionyces ben sayd a maner of round pylers / or Ionicum is sayd a foote of versyfyenge / whiche hath two syllabes shorte / and tweyne longe / By whiche he is shewed / that he was wyse & knowynge god / by Inquysycyon of thynges preuy and hydde / Wynghe of heuen by loue of thynges celestyall / and blessyd by possession of euerlastyng goodes / By other thynges it is shewed that he was a merueilous Rethour by eloquence / a susteynour and a berar vp of the chirch by doctryne / shorte to hym self by humylyte / and longe to other by Charyte / Saynt Austyn sayth in the eyght booke of the Cyte of God / that Ionyque is a kynde of Philosophres ytalyens / whiche ben toward ytalye / and Ionyques ben of the part of grece / And by cause that denys was a souerayne philosopher· he was named Ionyque / And Methodins of Constantynople endyted his lyf and his passion in grekesshe tongue / And Anastasius in latyn / Whiche was a writar of the byble of the chirche of Rome as ygnarus bisshop of Raynes sayth / ¶Of saint Denyse SAint Denyse Ariopagyte was conuertyd to the faythe of Ihesu Cryst of saynt powle thappostle And he was callyd Aryopagyte of the strete that he dwellyd And in that strete callyd Aryopage was the Temple of Mars / for they of Athenes named euery strete of the goddes that they worshiped in the same / And that strete / that they worshiped in the God Mars they called Aryopage / For Aryos is to saye mars / and pagus is a strete / and where they worshyped pan they named panopage / and soo of all other stretes / Aryopage was the moost excellent strete / by cause that the noble men haunted it / And therin were the scolers of the artes lyberalle / And denyse dwellyd in that strete / whiche was a ryght grete philosopher / And for as moche as the plante of wysedome of the deyte was in hym / he was called Theosophus / that is to saye / knowyng god / And one Appollophanus was his felawe in philosophye / There were also Epicurij / whiche sayde / that alle felycyte of man was in only delyte of the body / And stoycy / whiche helde oppynyon that it was in the only vertue of courage / And thenne on the daye of the passion of our lord / whan derkenesse was vpon the vnyuersalle worlde / the philosophres that were at Atthenes coude not fynde in causes naturelle the cause of that derkenesse / And it was no naturall eclypse / For the mone was thenne fro the sonne / & was xv dayes old / and soo was in a parfyght distaunce fro the sonne / And neuertheles an Eclypse taketh not awey the lyght in the vnyuersall partytyes of the world / And it maye not endure thre houres longe / And it appiereth that this eclypse took awey all the lyght / by that whiche saynt Luke sayth that our lord suffryd in alle his membrys / And by cause that the Eclypse was in Elyopolym / in Egypte / in Rome and in grece / And Orose sayth / that it was in gyece / and in the ende of Asye the lasse / And sayth / that whan our lord was nayled to the Crosse / ther was a ryght grete tremblyng & erth quaue thorugh the world / The Roches were cutte a sondre / and the Montaynes clouen / ryght grete floodes fylle in many partyes more than they were wonte to doo / And that day fro the sixthe houre vnto the nynthe houre the sonne loste his syghte thorugh oute alle the londes of the vnyuersall world And in that nyghte ther was no sterre sene in alle Egypte / And this remembryth Denys to Apolophanes sayenge in his Epystle / The world was derke communely of obscurete of derkenesses / And after the only dyametre retorned purged / And whanne he had founden that the sonne myght not suffre suche heuynes / And we ne maye not haue knowlege in our courage yet the mysterye of this thynge / by oure connynge and wysedome / And O Appollophanes myrrour of doctryne what shalle I saye of these secretes and hyd thynges / I attrybute and putte them to the / as to a mouthe dyuyne / and not as to vnderstondynge ne speche humayne / To whome he sayd / O good denyse / these ben the mutacions of dyuyne thynges / And in thende it is sygnyfyed al along the day and the yere of thanunciacion / that Powle our doctour sayd to our deef eeres / And by the signes that al men cryed whiche I remembryd / I haue founden the very trouth / and am delyuerd from the laas of falsenes / These ben the wordes of denys that he wrote in his epistle to polycarpe / and to Appollophanes sayenge / we were we tweyne at Helyopolym / & we sawe the Mone of heuen goo disordynately / And the tyme was not couenable / And yet ageyn fro the nynth houre vnto euensonge tyme at the Dyametre of the sonne establysshed aboue all naturel ordenaunce / That eclypse we sawe begynne in the eest / and comynge vnto the terme of the sonne / After that retornyng ageyne and not purged of that defaute / but was made contrarye after the Dyametre / Thenne Denys and Appollophanes wente to Helyopolyin in Egypte by desyre to lerne Astronomye / And after Denyse retourned ageyne / That the sayd Eclypse tooke aweye the lyght fro the vnyuersalle partyes of the world / It apperith that Eusebe wytnessyth in his Cronycles / whiche sayth that he hath redde in the dyctes af the Ethyncyens that ther was in Bythynnia / / whiche is a prouynce of Asye the lasse a grete erthe shakynge / And also the grettest derkenesse that myght be / And also sayth that in Nycene whiche is a cyte of Bytynne / that the erthe tremblynge threwe doune howses / And it is redde in Scolastica Historia that the Philosophers were brought to this / that they sayd / that god of nature suffred dethe / or els the ordynaunce of nature in this world was dissolued / or that the elementys lyeden / or god of nature suffred / And the elementis had pyte on hym / And it is sayd in another place that denyse sayth / this nyght sygnefyed that the newe very lyghte of the world shold come / And they of Atthenes made vnto this god an aulter / and sette this tytle therupon / This is the aulter of the god vnknowen & on euery aulter of their goddes the tytle was sette aboue in shewyng to whome that aulter was dedycate / & whanne that henyens wold make theyr sacryfyse vnto this vnknowen god The philosophres sayden / this god hath no nede of none of our goddes / but late vs knele doune to fore hym / and praye vnto hym deuoutely / For he requyreth not thoblacions of beestes / but the deuociōs of our corages / & after when the blessyd saynt pawle cam to Athenes / the philosophres Epicurij / and stoycy disputed with hym / Somme of them sayde / what wylle this sower of wordes s And thenne they brought hy sayd to hym / bryngest thow ony newe tydynges / we wold knowe what thou hast brought to vs / For thatenyens entended to none other thynge / but to here somme newe thynges / And thenne whanne saynt Powle hadde beholden al theyr aulters / He sawe amonge them the aulter of God vnknowen / and Pawle sayde / whome honoure ye that ye knowe not / Hym shewe I to yow to be very god that made heuen and erthe / And after he saide to Denyse / whome he sawe best lerned in dyuyne thynges / Denyse what is he that vnknowen god / And Denyse sayd / He is veryly a god / whiche amonge goddes is not shewed / but to vs he is vnknowen / and to come in to the world / and to regne withoute ende And pawle sayd / Is he a man only or spyryte / and Denyse sayd / he is god and man / but he is vnknowen / by cause his conuersacion is in heuen / Thenne sayd saynt powle / this is he that I preche / whiche descended fro heuen / And toke our nature humayne / and suffryd dethe / and aroos ageyne the thyrd day And as saynt denys disputed yet with saynt powle ther passed by aduenture by that way a blynd man / to fore them And anone Denys sayd to Powle / yf thow saye to this blynd man in the name of thy god / see / and thenne seeth I shal anone byleue in hym / but thou shalt vse no wordes of enchauntement For thou mayst happely knowe somme wordes that haue suche myghte and vertue / And pawle sayde / I shal write to fore the forme of the wordes / whiche ben these / In the name of Ihesu Cryste borne of the vyrgyne / crucyfyed and deed / whiche aroos ageyne / & ascended in to heuen / and from thens shal come for to Iuge the world / See And by cause that alle suspecion be taken awey / Pawle seyd to Denyse / that he hym self shold pronounce tho wordes / And whanne Denyse had seyd those wordes in the same maner to the blynd man / Anone the blynd man recouerd his syghte / And thenne Denys was baptysed / And Damare hys wyf / and alle his meyny / And was a trewe Crysten man / And was Instructe and taughte by seynt Powle thre yere / and was ordeyned Bisshop of Athenes / And there was in predycacion / And conuertyd that Cyte / and grete pāte of the regyon to crysten feith And it is seyd that seynt Powle shewed to hym that he sawe whanne he was rauysshed in to the thyrd heuen / lyke as seynt Denyse seyth & shewyth / in dyuerse places / wherof he speketh so clerly of the gerarchyes of Aungels / of the ordres and of the disposicions & offyces of them / soo that it is not supposed that he lerned of ony other / but only of hym that was rauysshed vnto the thyrdde heuen / and hadde sene alle thynges / He flouryd by the spyryte of prophecye / lyke as it appieryth in an epystle that he sente to Iohan theuangelyst in the yle of pathmos / to whiche he was sente in exyle / where as he prophecyed that he shold come ageyne sareng thus / Enioye thou veryly byloued / very wonderfulle / and to be desyred ryʒt well byloued / thow shalt be laten oute fro the kepynge that thow hast in pathmos / And shalt retorne vnto the land of Asye / And thou there make there the folowynge of thy good god and the good werkes of hym / and shalt delyuer them to them that shalle come after the / And as it is sene and shewed in the booke of the names dyuyne / he was at the deyenge of the blessyd virgyne Marye / And whanne he herd that peter & powle were enprysoned at Rome vnder Nero / he ordeyned a Bisshop vnder hym and cam for to vysyte them And whanne they were martryd and passyd to god / And Clement was sett in the see of Rome / After a certayne tyme he was sente of the seyd Clement in to Fraunce / and he hadde in his companye Rustyke and Elentherye / And thenne he cam with them to parys / and conuerted there moche peple to the faith and dyde doo make many Chirches / & sette in them

beten / bespytte / and despysed / and fast to be bounden wyth Rustyke and Elentherye / and to be brought to fore hym / And whan he sawe that the sayntes were constaunt and ferme in the knowlechynge of oure lord / he was moche heuy / and soroufull / Thenne cam thyder a noble matrone / whiche sayd that her husbond was fowly deceyued of these enchaunteurs And thenne anone the husbond was sente fore / And he abydynge in the cōfession of our lord was anone putte to deth / And the sayntes were beten cruelly of twelue knyʒtes / and were straytly bounden with chaynes of yron / & put in pryson / the day folowynge Denys was leyd vpon a gredyron / and stratched al naked vppon the celes of fyre / And there he sange to our lord sayeng / Lord / thy word is vehemently firy / And thy seruaunt is enbraced in the loue therof / And after that he was putte amonge cruel beestes / whiche were excited by grete hongre and famyne / by longe fastynge / And as soone as they cam rennynge vpon hym / he maade the signe of the crosse ageynste them / & anone they were made mooste meke & tame / And after that he was cast in to a fornais of fyre / and the fyre anone quenchyd / And he hadde neyther payne

And as he song ther the masse / and communed the peuple / our lord appyeryd to hym with greete lyght / and delyuerd to hym brede sayenge / Take this my dere frende / For thy reward is moost grete with

thynges to the plesyng of god / And shal ende his lyf in the loue of our lord graciously / And whan this holy bisshop awoke / he knelyd doune / and maade his prayers with shedyng of teres / And though that pees was not yet reformed / Neuertheles he thanked almyghty god / that he was certayne / that by goddes grace he shold see hit / in his dayes / wherfor he wente aboute / and prechid to the peple for to doo penaunce / And our lord shold shewe to vs mercy / and gyue to vs pees / and alle thynges plentyuous / And in this werre was the kyng slayne by treason / And he was buryed at glastenbury / Thenne bothe his sones were broughte to kynge Canutus the dane / to doo with them what he wold / And whan he sawe them / he myght not for pyte slee them / but sente them o Englond peasybly / whan the ryghtfull blood were destroyed / Notwithstondyng they were preseruyd & kepte alyue / and were conueyed to the Emperour of Rome / the whiche kepte them / tyll saynt Edward was maade kyng of Englond / & thenne he maryed tholdest of them to a cosyn of his / by cause of the loue that they had to kyng Edward / whiche was vncle to them / Thenne hadde kyng Canute the rewle of Englond by strong honde / Alle lawe & good rewle set a syde / For in his dayes was full moche trouble and robberye with other grete oppressions and Importable charges among the comonte / For he drad no man / excepte the ij

many and specially among holy monkes / And vsyd to praye ayd saye in this maner / O good lord I haue none helpe but the only / my frendes ben gone fro me / And they ben become myn aduersaryes / Myn fader is deed / My bretheren ben slayne / My moder is wedded to my moost enemy / And I am left allone / And daily they seke the moyens to slee me / but to the lord I am left poure / I beseche the lord to helpe me that am a faderles child / for thou somtyme helpedest merueylously Edwyn and Oswold / whiche were exyled and ordeyned for to deye / Thow defendest them only from deth / but also thou good

consecrate hym enoynted / and crowned hym kyng of Englond O good lord / what ioye and gladnes was thenne in Englond / For whanne the old felycyte of this lond was almost despayred thēne it was kyndeled ageyn by the comynge of this blessyd kyng saynt Edward / Thēne had the comyns reste & pees / & the lordes & gentil men reste & honour / And thenne holy chirche receyued alle her lybertees ageyne / Thenne was the sunne lyfte vp / and the mone sette in his ordre / that is saye / preestes shyned in wysedome & in holynes / The monasteryes flouryd in deuocion by holy relygyon / The Clerkes gaf lyght & prosperyd in their offices to the plesure of god / The comyn peple were content and were ioyefull in their degree / and in this kynges dayes ther was no venym that myght thenne corrupte the erthe with pestylence / and in the see none outragyous tempestes / & the londe plentyuous of all maner of fruytes / And in the Clergye nothynge inordynate / and amonge the comyng peple was no

ageynste this Royamme of englond / And what fylle therof / it shal be declared here after more openly / for this holy kynge Edward was euer full of mekenes and of vertue / And neuer lyft vp by vayne glorye / but euer he remembryd the wordes of oure lord that sayth / I haue sette the prynce of the peple / but be not therfore lyfte vp in vayne glorye / but be thou amonge them / as one of them / He was amonge his houshold men egall and famylyer / among preestes meke and debonayre / to his peple amyable / & chyerful / To wretchis and nedy men ful of compassion / and large of almesse yeuynge / He was also moche deuoute in the seruyse of god / And dylygent to repayre and reedefye Chirches that were destroyed by the danes / And in Iugement fulle discrete / consideryng no mans persone / but only the weyght of his cause / as well to the riche / as to the poure / and he hadde rychesse ynough / & And his tresour semed comyn to alle poure men / his wordes were sad & discrete / & medlyd with myrthe / spekyng ofte of Ihesu Cryst the second persone in the Trynyte / And of oure blessyd lady his moder / And somtyme he spak sharply / as he sawe nede correctyng trespassours / gentyl & swete to good men He was neuer elate ne enhaunced in pryde / no dishonest by glotonye / He wolde not be compellyd by wrathe / ne enclyne for yefte / He despysed rychesse and was neuer sory for losse of worldly goodes and rychesses / ne the more gladde for wynnynge therof / in suche wyse / that alle men merueyled of the sadnes of hym / And aboute the kyng were dyuerse coueitous men / whiche said to the kyng how his tresoure wastyd faste / And yf the danes come ageyne / he hadde not where with to defende hym / wherfor they counceiled hym to reyse an ayde amonge his comyns lyke as kynge Canute hadde done dyuerse tymes / An ayde was thenne cleped the dane ghelte / And they counceiled to doo in lyke wyse / And he said nay / And he wold not agree therto Notwithstondynge / they dayly cryed vpon hym / & when he sawe them so importune / & shewed so grete peryls / thenne at the laste he saide to them to preue them / late vs see / how ye wyll do / And whan they herd that of his owen mouthe were ryght gladde / & sente out commyssiones for to gadre it / & spared no countrey but made them paye in the largest wyse / & whan this money was leueyed & brought in to the kynges tresorye / thenne they brought the kyng thyder for to see it / The kyng thēne standyng a fer fro it sawe the deuyll in lykenes of an ape sittyng vpon y e tresour And sayd what haue ye done / & what money haue ye broughte to me / Forsoth there shalle not one peny be spente to myn vse / but I charge yow for to delyuer to eche man his money ageyne / but therto they were moche lothe / & saide that they myght spende it in dedes of charyte / Thenne the kyng sayd shold spende the goodes of other men / For what almesse shold I make with y e godes of poure comyns & lauborers / see ye not how the deuyll sytteth vpon the hepe of money / & maketh grete ioye that he hath taken vs in his snare / wherfor I charge you on paine of dethe / that ye delyuer this money ageyne / there as ye had it euery peny / Thenne they obeyed the kyng / and repaid it vnto them / of whome they had receyued it / and durst neuer after moeue the kyng to suche maters / ne in none other lyke / so that all the dayes of saint Edward was neyther taske ne tayllage leueyed amōge his comyns / whiche was a grete ioye to the royame In a tyme the kynge was seke lyeng in his bedde / And ther stode in his chābre a cheste open full of gold & syluer And a clerke cam / in supposynge the kynge had slepte / and took oute of it a certayne somme of money / & wente his way / And soone after he cam agayne / & wold haue taken more / thenne the kyng said / Forsothe now thow arte vnwyse to come ageyne / For thou haddest suffycyently ynow to fore / therfore beware / For yf the tresorer come / & fynde the / thou arte lyke to deye therfore / wherfor yf thow loue thy lyf / flee fast awey with that that thow hast / And anone after cam the tresorer / and fond hou of the tresour was born aweye a grete parte / And sought and enquyred dylygently for the theef / that stale hit / And the kyng seyng the grete trouble and sorowe of the tresorer demaunded hym the cause of his heuynes And whan he had told to the kyng / the kyng sayd to hym / sorowe no more therfore / For peraduentur he that hath it hath more nede to it / than we / And so the theef escaped & was not pursued after / when all thynges were quyete in the Royamme / the counceill of the londe assemblyd for to treate for a maryage / for the kyng / whiche thyng whan it was moeued he was gretely abasshed dredyng to lese the tresour of his vyrgynyte / whiche was kepte in a fraylle and brutyll vessell / and what he shold doo or say / he wyst not / For yf he shold obstynatly denye it / he dradde lest his auowe of chastyte shold be openly knowen / and yf he consentid therto / he dred to lese his chastyte / wherfor he commended hym self only to god sayenge these wordes / O good lord / thow delyuer dest somtyme thre Chyldren fro the flamme of fyre in the chymeney and fornais of the chaldyes / and by the lorde Ioseph escaped with his chastyte / fro the wyf of putyphar she holdyng his mantell / And yet by thy mercy he escaped / & good lord by thy vertu Susanne was delyuerd fro the dethe / to the whiche thold vnchaste preestes hadde dampned her to / And by thy myghte lord Iudyth escaped whan she hadde slayne Holofernes / And reseruyd her fro defowlyng / & escaped withoute hurte / And aboue all other thow hast preseruyd thy blessyd moder moost best & swettest lady / she beynge bothe wyf & vyrgyne / / thenne beholde on me thy seruaunt / and sone of thyn handemayde / that am in grete

to his astate / And amonge all the virgyns of the londe Edithe doughter of erle goodwyn was founden moste acordyng to hym by her vertuous condicions / and her fader ma grete meanes to the kynges counceille for to accomplysshe this maryage / by whiche he myght come in the kynges conceyte / •d And by his wysedom / for his grete myʒt & power he had his entent & whan the maryage was solempnysed and accomplysshed by the holy sacrament / He and the quene auowed to lyue to gydre chaste secretely / that noman knewe it but god allone / The was bitwene them a lonyng spousehede withoute bodyly knowyng of dede / Chast embracynge withoute defloracion of vyrgynyte / Ther was bytwene them veryly chast loue withoute flesshely towchynge and knowyng / Afterward somme of the Royamme grutchid / sayeng / he had taken a wyf by compulsion ageynste his wylle / of an vnkynde lygnage / And wold not knowe his wyf / by cause he wold not bryng forth mo tyrauntes / And this none knewe the veray trouthe of his chast lyf whyles he lyued / but the very clennesse of his mynde was suffycyent wytnes of his chastyte / ¶ Hit happend on a wytsonday as the kyng was crowned at westmestre in his astate / And knelyng made his prayers deuoutely for the tranquyllyte & pees / of his londe / byfore the aulter of the blessyd trynyte / atte leuacion of the blessyd sacrament / he fylle in a softe & demure lawhyng / soo that the lordes that were there present awaytyng on hym merueyled gretely / but durst saye no thyng to hym tyll the seruyse was done / Thenne one that was hardyer / than another demaunded of hym the cause of his lawhyng / And thenne he told to hym / how the danes had assemblyd a grete power of peple ageynste the Royamme of Englond / And were entrynge in to their shippes / And as the kynge of denmarke wold haue entryd in to the shippe / sodenly his strengthe was taken from hym / And soo fell in to the See / bytwene two shippes / & was drowned / by whoos dethe the peple of denmarke and also of Englond were delyuerd fro synne and parylle / They herynge this merueyled gretely / and sent in to denmarke to knowe the trouthe / And when the Messagers retorned / they reported that it was trewe as the kynge had sayd / And that the kyng of denmarke was drowned that same tyme that saynt Edward lowhe / After this the noble saynt Edward remembryd his auowe and promesse to vysyte saynt peter at Rome / whiche he made in Normandye / wherfore he lete calle his comyns and his lordes to a Counycelle to fore hym / wherof he come ned with them / how and in what maner he myght departe / and of the gouernaunce of the Royamme in his absence what peuple sholde be conuenyent for taccompanye hym / And what Money shold suffyse hym and his meyny / and when the lordes and comyns herd this / they were full heuy and sorowful that he shold departe from them / And he seyng their heuynesse comforted them / & said how that our lord had sent to them pees / & by his good grace shold contynue the same in his absence / yet notwithstondyng the peple requyred hym to sende vnto the pope to be assoylled of his auowe / or els dylaye it tyl another tyme / And the kynge seyng the sorowe and lamentacion of his peple· whiche wepte & wrong their handes / & as peple amased withoute a defendour and kepar / comforted them & graunted tabyde stylle with them / And ordeyned certayne Bisshops for to go to Rome & to aske of oure holy fader counceylle / how he myght be assoilled of this auowe that he had made to visite saint Peter / And thenne tharchebisshop of yorke & bisshop of wynchestre & ij abbots with dyuerse clerkes & laye men went to Rome / & when they cam to Rome the pope had made that tyme a grete cōgregacion of clerkes of dyuerse grete maters belongyng to holy chirche / & when the pope wist of their comyng / he was ryght glad & sent for them / & the pope badde them telle the cause of her comynge / & anon scylence was made / & they exposed the cause of their comyng / & recited the auowe & the desyre of kyng Edward / the peryl of the Royame / the trouble / the drede of the peple / the brekyng of the pees / the clamour of the poure comyns / the ieopardy of the kynge in his absence / & the piteous destruction which the danes had late made by their cruelte / & also declared the grete deuocion that he had to visite the holy appostles Peter & Powle / thenne the pope & the clergye merueiled gretely / & gaf lawde & praisynge vnto almyʒty god that he had sent so deuoute & vertuous a prynce in the angle of the world to mayntene by his wisedom the cristen faithe / And how dredefull he was to offende ageynst the hooly Chirche / And whanne the pope vnderstoode how his peple louyd hym / & how soroufull wold be of his departyng / They merueyled gretely / and thouʒte veryly / that he was gretely bylouyd of god / & was with hym in alle his werkes / For they sawe in hym the mekenes of dauyd / the chastyte of Ioseph and the Rychesse of Salamon / And yet he sette nought ther by / thenne the pope consyderynge the grete perylles / that myghte ensi assoylled hym of his auowe / of which he sent to hym a bulle vnder leed / And enioyned hym in penaunce to yeue the goodes that he shold haue spente in his pylgremage to dedes of charyte and to reedyfye som chirche of saynt peter / and endowe hit with sufficient lyuelode / And thenne the messagers receyued the popes blessynge / And retorned in to Englond / & cam vnto the kyng at westmestre / and whan the kyng vnderstode how he was assoylled of his auowe / And how they had spedde / he was glad / & thanked almyghty god / & our hooly fader the pope / There was an hooly man a recluse in the dyocyse of worceter / whiche knewe no thynge of the counceyll assemblyd vpon the gouernaunce of the lande / ne of tha uowe of the kynge / ne of the message sente to Rome / To whome saint Peter appyerid in a nyght / & said to hym / how kynge Edward had sente to Rome to be assoylled of the auowe that he made / when he was beyonde the see / and he hath grete conscyence by cause his counceylle wol not suffre hym taccomplysshe hit in goyng in his propre persone to Rome / wherfor thow shalt wryte to hym in my name / & gyue hym knowlege / that he is assoylled by myn auctoryte fro the bonde of his auowe / And how he shall haue in commaundement of the pope for his penaunce / to yeue suche goodes as he hath ordeygned for his exspensis to poure men / and to make a newe Abbay in thonour of saynt Peter / or to repayre an old one / and tendewe it suffyciently / and wryte to hym / that by the same token / that he chaas me somtyme to his patrone in Normandy / that he repayre the Abbaye called Thorney / in the west syde of the Cyte of london / whiche somtyme I halowed my self / And late hym sette therin Monkes of good conuersacyon / For fro that place shall be a ladder stratchyng in to heuen And Aungels descendynge and ascendynge / berynge vp to heuen to oure lord the prayers of meke and deuoute men / ¶ And to him that ascendeth by that ladder / I shalle opene the yates of heuen / lyke as our lord hath enioyned me by myn offyce / and I shal lose them / that ben bounden / and receyue them / that ben vnbounde / Alle this that thow hast herd of me / thow shalt wryte it / and sende it to kynge Edward / whiche thenne was many a myle thens / And the Messager / that cam fro this Anker or recluse / cam to the presence of the kynge / the same tyme / that the Bisshops cam fro Rome And when the kynge hadde receyued the lettres that cam fro Rome with grete reuerence / and redde them / he thanked God / that he was soo clerely releced of the bonde of his auowe / And thenne he commaunded the lettres of the Recluse to be redde / And when they were redde / and sawe they were acordynge to the lettres / that cam fro Rome / he humbly thanked god / & saynt peter his patrone / and Incontynent disposid hym to fulfille his penaunce / And began to repayre thabbaye that he was assigned to repayre by the glorious appostle saint peter / and yaf largely almesse to poure peple / & fraunchysed al Englond of the trybute / that was vsyd yerely to be payd to the danes for euermore / On a tyme when kyng Edward was at westmynstre / ther cam to hym a Crepyl born in Irlond / whiche was named Gylemychell And this Crepyl had no feet / but wente vpon his handes & knees hauyng in either hand a lytel stole to go with His legges were bothe bent backward and cleuyd to his thyes / and his toes grewe fast to his buttokkes / This Crepyl entrid boldly in to the kynges palais / and cam to the kynges chambre dore / And one Hulyn the kynges chamberlayn demaunded hym shurply what he dyde there / To whome the crepil seid lette me not I pray you for I must nedes speke to the kynge / For I haue be out of this londe sixe tymes to vysyte the hooly Relyques of the holy appostle seint peter to thentent for to be heled / and saynt peter denyed me not but badde me goo in to englond / & late the kyng bere me on his back in to the Chirche of saynt Peter / & thēne I shal be made parfyghtly hoole / which thynge was tolde to the kyng by the same Hulyn / & anone the kyng had pyte on the poure man / and desdeygned not / but took hym on his sholdres / & bare hym / whom the crypel beclypped with his fowle & skabby hondes & armes / & soo in the beryng his synewes losed / & were retchyd oute / And of kyrnellys & botches of his face & of scurffys ther ranne grete plente of blood and atter on the kynges clothes / whiche was tolde to the kynge / & also that he was al hoole / but the kyng took none hede therto / but bare hym to the hyhe aulter / and ther he was sette doune on his feet / & was made parfyghtely hoole to ryde or go whyder he wold / but the kyng wold in no wyse haue this myracle ascrybed to hym / but yaf to hym a reward & bad hym go to rome & thanke god & his holy appostle saint peter / In the tyme of kynge Athelberte / whiche regned in kent / And Sygebert in myddelsex / whiche were conuertid to the faythe of Cryst by saynt Austyn / whiche Athelbert made in london within the Cyte a noble & ryall chirche in thonoure of seynt Powle / in whiche saynt Austyn ordeyned saynt Mellyte to be bisshop of that Cyte / whiche thynge was not satisfyed with that good dede but thought And also did do make another chirche in the west ende of the Cyte / whiche thēne was called Thorney / & now is named westmynstre / whiche chirche he prayd Mellyte for to halowe in thonour of saynt Peter / and the nyght before that he had purposed to halowe it / saynt Peter appyered to a fisshar in Temse / & bad hym set hym ouer fro stangate to westmynstre / And he prayd the fysshar to abyde hym there tyll he come ageyne / & he wold well rewarde hym / for his labour / And soone after the fysshar sawe saint Peter entre in to the Chirche with a grete lyght / whiche lyght endured contynuelly as longe as he was in the chirche / And a certeyne space after he retorned to the fysshar / axynge hym yf he hadde ony mete to ete / And the fysshar was soo gretely abasshed of the lyght that yssued oute of the chirche with hym / that he durste not speke to hym / To whome soynt Peter sayde / Broder / drede the not / I am a man as thow art / hast thow take ony fysshe / & he sayd nay / For I haue awayted on yow alle this nyght / whyle ye haue ben in the chirche / And thenne they entryd in to the bote / And saynt Peter commaunded hym to caste out his nette / And whanne he had so done / there cam soo grete a multitude of grete fysshys in to his nette / that vnnethe they myght drawe vp the nette for brekynge / And whan they were come to lond Seynt Peter deuyded the fysshes / and and delyuer it to hym / And telle to hym that I haue halowed the chirche of westmynstre this nyght / And saye to hym / that he saye masse therm to morowe / & yf he wylle not byleue it / saye to hym / whan he cometh / he shall fynde there tokenes suffycyent / And I shalle be patrone of that chirche / and vysyte it of tymes / and bere in the syght of almyʒty god / the prayers and deuocions of trewe cristen peple that pray in that place / & take thou the remenaunt of the fysshe for thy labour / And this sayd / saynt Peter vanysshed away / Thenne the fyssher merueyled gretely of the syght that he hadde sene / And erly by the morowe he wente to the Bisshoppe Mellyte of london / & delyuerd to hym the fysshe that saynt Peter had sent to hym / & tolde to hym by ordre / lyke as saynt Peter hadde gyuen hym charge / & as ye haue herd to fore / but the Bisshop wold not bileue hym til he cam to westmestre & see the tokenes for to put hym oute of doubte / & whan he had opened the chirch dore he fonde a crosse made of sonde / fro that one syde of the chirche vnto that other wit e places that were enoynted with hooly oyle / whiche yet were moyst and appyered newely done / Thenne the Bisshop byleuyd this thynge veryly / & sayd masse that same daye in the chirche / And there prechyd to the peuple a gloryous sermon / And declared the grete myracle openly / wherfore the people gaf laude and praysynge to god / and to hys gloryous Appostle saynt Peter / And whanne saynt Edward vnderstode / that this chirche was of old tyme halowed by saynt Peter / And how saynt Peter hadde commaunded hym to repaire the same Chirche / as the lettre of the recluse maketh mencion / Soo thenne euer after he hadde full grete deuocion to the same place / And he dyd do caste doune the old werke / and dyd do bylde it vp newe / and endowed that Monastery worshipfully with lyuelode & Iewellis / And at that tyme pope Leo was deed / And pope Nycholas was after hym / And thenne the kynge to gyue relacion to hym of his penaunce enioyned by leo his predecessour / to re and Pawle / to be dampned with Iudas in helle euerlastyngly to lye in payne / Thenne the Messagyers retourned ageyne fro Rome with the lettres of confyrmacion / And whan the kynge sawe the grete benyuolence of our hooly fader the pope / and hys fauour and gentylnesse / gyuynge to hym by wrytynge moo pryueleges / & fredom than he desyrede / Thenne he was fulle of gladnesse and ioye / and thonked almyghty god of alle his yeftes / On a tyme the kynge was in the chirche of saynt peter at westmynstre / and was disposed in grete deuocion / as his customme was to here masse / Erle Leofryke kneled behynde the kyng / and sawe with his bodyly eyen our lord Ihesu cryst bytwene the preestes handes / appyerynge in the lykenes of a gloryous childe or beauteuous persone / whiche blessyd the kynge with his ryght honde / And the kynge whiche was gretely comforted with the sight bowed doune his hede / and with grete deuocion and mekenes receyued the blessynge of our lord / Thenne the erle aroos to telle the kynge / supposynge that the kynge

places be deputed to dyuerse sowles for our Instruction / as it happed at Marys / There was a maister / whiche was chaūceler at parys named Sylo / whiche had a scoler seke / And he prayd hym / that after his deth he shold come ageyne to hym / and saye to hym of his estate / And he promysed hym so to do / and after deyde / And a whyle after he appyered to hym / clad in a Cope wreton fulle of argumentis fallacions and sophymmes / & was of parchemyn / And within forth all fulle of flambe of fyre / And the chaunceler demaunded hym what he was / And he told to hym / I am suche one / that am

had in my Sophyms and Sophystycall argumentes / that is to saye deceyuable and fallacions / The skynnes ben lyghte / but the flamme of fyre within forth tormenteth / and al to brenneth me / And whanne the maystre Iuged the payne to be lyght / the dede scoler said to hym / that he shold put forthe his honde / and fele the lyʒtnes of his payne / and he put forth his hand / And that other lete falle a drope of his swete on hit / And the drope percyd thorugh his hand sonner than an arowe coude be shoten thorugh / wherby he felte a merueylous tormente And the dede man sayde / I am all in suche payne / And thenne the chaunceler was all aferd of the cruel and terryble payne / that he hadde felte / concluded to forsake the world / and entryd in to relygyon with grete deuocion / Fourthly for the synne that hath be cōmysed in the place / As saynt Augustyn saith / Sōtyme sowles be punysshed in y e places where they haue synned as appiereth by an ensample that saint gregory reciteth in the fourthe book of his dyalogue / and saith that ther was a preest / whiche vsyd gladly a bayne / & whan he cam in to the bayne / he fonde a man whome he knewe alwey redy for to serue hym / And it happed on a day that for his dylygent seruyse / and his reward the preest gaf to hym an hooly loof / And he wepyng answerd / Fader wherfor gyuest thow me this thynge / I may not ete it / for it is holy / I was somtyme lord of this place / but after my dethe I was deputed for to serue here for my synnes / but I pray the that thou wylt offre this brede vnto almyʒty god for my synnes / And knowe thou for certayne that thy prayer shalle be herd / And whan thenne thou shalte come to wasshe the / thou shalt not fynde me / And thenne this preest offryd alle a weke entiere sacryfyse to god / for hym / And when he cam ageyne / he fonde hym not / Fyftly dyuerse places ar deputed to dyuerse sowles for y e prayers of somme saynt / as it is redde of saynt patryke / that he Impetred a place of purgatory in Irelond for somme Of whiche thystory is wreton to fore in his lyf / And as to the thyrdde / that is suffrages / thre thynges ought to be consydered / Fyrste the suffrages that ben done / Secondly of them / for whom they be done / Thirdly of them by whom they be done / Aboute the suffrages that ben done / It is to be noted / that there ben done four maner of suffrages / whiche prouffite vnto them that ben deed / that is to wete prayers of good Frendes / gyuynge of almesses / Syngynge of masses / and obseruacion of fastynges As touchyng to that / that the prayers of frendes prouffite to them / It appiereth by ensample of paschasyen / of whome gregory telleth in the fourth booke of his dyalogues / and saith that there was a man of grete holynesse & vertu And two were chosen for to haue ben popes / but neuertheles at the laste the Chirche accorded vnto one of them / And this paschasyen alwey by errour suffred that other / And abode in thys errour vnto the dethe / And whanne he was dede the byere was couerd with a clothe named dalmatyke / one that was vexyd with a deuyll was brought thyder / and touchyd the clothe / and anon he was made hole / And a long tyme after as saynt Germayn bisshop of capuenne / wente to wesshe hym in a bayne for his helthe / he fonde paschasyen deken there and seruyd / & whan he sawe hym / he was aferd / and enquyred dylygently / what thynge so grete and so holy a man made there / And he sayd to hym that he was there for none other cause / but for that he helde and susteyned more than ryght requyred in the cause afore said / and saide I requyre the that thou praye oure lord for me / And knowe that thow shalt be herd / For when thou shalt come ageyne thou shalt not fynde me here / And thenne the Bisshop praid for hym / and when he cam ageyne he fonde hym not / And Pieter Abbot of Cluny saith that ther was a preest that song euery day masse of Requiem for all Crysten soules / And herof he was accused to the bisshop / and was suspended therfore of his offyce / And as the Bisshop went on a daye of grete solempnyte in the Chirche yerd / all the dede bodyes aroos vp ageynst hym sayeng / this Bisshop gyueth to vs no masse / And yet he hath taken awey our preest fro vs / Now he shalle be certeyne / but yf he amende he shalle deye / And thenne the Bisshop assoylled the preest / and sange hym self gladly for them that were passid oute of this world / And so it appierith that the prayers of lyuyng peple ben prouffitable to them that ben departed / by this that the Chauntour of parys reherceth / Ther was a man that alweye as he passed thorugh the Chirche yerd / he sayd De profundis for alle Crysten sowles / And on a tyme he was bysette with his enemyes / so that for socour he leep in to the chircheyerd / And they folowed for to haue slayn hym / And anone all the dede bodyes arose / and eche helde suche a Instrument in his hand that they defended hym that prayde for them / And chaced aweye his enemyes puttynge them in grete fere / And the Second manere of suffrages is for to gyue almesses / and that helpeth them / that ben in purgatory / as it appiereth in the book of Machabeis / where hit is redde / that Iudas the most strong man made a collacion / and sente to Ierusalem xij thousand drammes of syluer there to be offryd for the synnes of dede men / remembrynge ryghtfully and relygyously of the resurection / And how moche to gyue almesse auayleth for them / that ben departed it appyereth by ensample that saynt gregorye putteth in his fourthe booke of dyalogues / There was a knyght that lay dede / and his spyryte taken fro hym / And a whyle after / the sowle retorned to the body ageyne / And what he had sene done / he told and said ther was a brydge / And vnder that brydge was a flood fowle / horryble / and full of stenche / and on that other syde of the brydge was a medowe swete odoraunt and aourned full of all maner floures / And there on that syde of the brydge were peples assembled cladde al in whyte that were fylled with the swete odoure of the floures / And the brydge was suche / that yf ony of the mynystres wold passe ouer the brydge / he shold slyde and falle in to that stynkyng Ryuer / And the ryghtwys peple passid ouer lyghtly and surely / in to that delectable place / And this knyght sawe ther a man named Pieter / whiche laye bounden / and grete weyght of yron vpon hym / whiche whan he axyd / why he lay soo there / It was said to hym of another he suffreth by cause yf ony man were delyuerd to hym to do vengeaunce / He desyred it more to do it by cruelte / than by obedyence / Also he said / he sawe there a pylgrym / that whan he cam to the brydge / he passid ouer with grete lyghtnes and shortely by cause he hadde wel lyued here / and purely in the world / and withoute synne / And he sawe there another named Stephen / whiche whanne he wold haue passid / his fote slode that he fylle half ouer the bridge / And thenne ther cam somme horryble black men / And dyd all that they myght to drawe hym doune by the legges / And thenne cam other ryght fair Creatures and whyte / and took hym / by the armes / and drewe hym vp / And as this stryf endured / this knyght that saw these thynges retorned to his body / and knewe not whiche of them vaynquysshed / But this way we vnderstonde that the wycked dedes / that he had done / strofe ageynst the werkes of almesses / For by them that drewe hym by the armes vpward / hit appierid that he louyd almesses / And by the other / that he had not parfightely lyuyd ageynste the synnes of the flesshe / The thyrdde maner of suffrages is the oblacion and offryng of the holy sacrament of the aulter / whiche prouffiteth moche to them that ben departed as it appiereth by many ensamples / lyke as saynt gregory recounteth in the fourthe book of his dyalogue / that one of his monkes named Iustus / whan he cam to his last ende / he shewed that he had hydde thre pens of gold / And therof sorowed sore / And anone after he deyde / And thenne saynt gregory comaunded his bretheren / that they shold burye his body in a donghylle / And the thre pieces of gold with hym / sayenge / thy money be to the in perdycion Neuertheles seynt Gregory commaunded one of his bretheren to saye for him euery day masse thyrtty dayes longe / And so he dyde / And whan he hadde accomplysshed his terme / the monke that was dede appierid on the thyrttyest day to one / whiche demaunded how it was with hym / And he ansuerde to hym / I haue ben euylle at ease vnto this day / but I am now wel / I haue this day receyued commynyon / & this sacrifice of thaulter prouffiteth not only to them y t ben dede / but also to them y t ben lyuyng in this world / It happed there was a man whiche was with other labourid in a roche for to dygge for syluer / & sodenly y e roche fyll on them / & slewe them al sauf this one man / which was sauyd in a creuyce of the roche / but for al y t he myʒt not yssue ne go out / & his wyf supposed y t he had ben dede / & did do synge euery day a masse for hym / & bare euery day to thoffryng a loof & a pot of wyne & a candel / & the deuyll which had enuye herat appierid thre dayes contynuel to this womā in forme of a mā & demāded her whyder she wēt / & when she had said to hym / he sayd to her / thow gost in vayn / for the masse is done And thus she lefte the masse thre dayes / that she dyde not synge for hym / And after this another man dygged in the same Roche for syluer / And herde vnder this the voys of this man / whiche sayd to hym / smyte softe / and spare thyn honde / For I haue a grete stone hangynge ouer my hede / And he was aferd / and called mo men to hym for to here this voys / and began to digge ageyne / And thenne they herd semblably that voys / And thenne they wente more ner / And sayd who arte thou / And he sayd I pray yow to spare your smytyng / For a grete stone hangeth ouer my hede / and thenne they wente· and digged on that one syde til that they cam to hym / and drewe hym oute al hole / And they enquyred of hym / In what maner he had so long lyned there / And he sayd / that euery day was brought to hym a loof / a pot wyn and a candell / sauf these thre dayes / And whanne his wyf herd that / she had grete ioye / And knewe well / that he had be susteyned of her offryng / and that the deuyll had deceyued her / that she had do synge no masse tho thre dayes / And as Peter thabbot of Cluny wytnessyth and sayth / that in the toun of ferare in the dyocise of granepolytane / that a maronner was fallen in to the see by a tempest / and anone a preest sange masse for hym / And at the laste he cam oute of the see / al sauf / And whan he was demaunded how he escaped / he said / that whan he was in the See / and almost dede / ther cam to hym a man whiche gaf to hym brede / And whanne he had eten / he was well comforted / and recouerd his strengthe / and was taken vp of a ship that passed by And that was founden that hit was the same tyme that the preest offrid to god the blessyd sacrament for hym / And the fourthe maner of suffrages / that prouffiteth to them that ben dede / is fastyng / • is 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉 Seynt Gregorye in spekyng of thys matere / and of thre other wytnessyth it and saith / the sowles of them / that ben departed ben assoilled in foure maners / by thoblacion of preestes / by the prayers of sayntes / by the almesse of frendes / and by the fastynges of theyr kynnesmen / that the penaunce done for them by their Frendes is vaillable to them / hit is shewed by a solempne Doctour / whiche reherceth that there was a woman / whiche hadde her husbond dede And she was in grete despair for pouerte / And the deuyll appierid to her / and sayd that he wold make her ryche / yf she wold do as he wold saye to her And she promysed to do hit / And he enioyned her that the men of the chirche that she shold receyue in to her hous that she shold make them doo fornycacion / Secondly that she sholde take in to her hows by daye tyme poure men / And in the nyght dryue them oute voide and hauynge no thyng / Thirdly that she shold in the Chirche lette prayers by her Ianglyng / And that she shold not confesse her of none of alle these thynges / And at the laste as she approched toward her deth / her sone warned her to be confessid / And she discouered to hym what she had promysed / And saide / that she myght not be shryuen / And that her confession shold auaylle her no thyng / But her sone hasted her / and saide he wold do penaunce for her / she repentid her / and sente for to fetche the preest / But to fore er the preest cam / the deuyls ronnen to her / and she deyde by thoorryblenes of hem / Thenne the sone confessid the synne of the moder .
